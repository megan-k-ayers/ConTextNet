"Hi, have you ever heard of the charity ""Save the Children"" before? Save the Children is a charity organization that provides funding to help get children access to health and education all over the world   Yeah St Jude's is a great organization that helps find cures for diseases.  There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.   Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food. Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.  URL here you go I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack.  Great happy to help! Thanks for a nice conversation",0,FALSE

"Hey, how are you doing, have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children? It's an international organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries, does that sound like something you'd get behind? May I ask why? Your help could really make a difference in a child's life, think of a child who didn't have enough to eat, just a small bit of help may have saved them, are you sure you're not interested? That's great, it sounds like it's an issue you really care about then, why not put some of that effort into a charity that's doing really great work like Save the Children? I'm not asking you to donate years of your life, just a couple of cents if possible, is that something you could possibly do tonight? You're probably on a computer right now, so you probably have quite a bit of money yourself, don't you think you could spare maybe 25 cents for some needy children around the world? Do you have children yourself? What if your children were in a position these kids are in, wouldn't you want someone to help them? If only they had parental support, but in war-torn countries like Syria their parents are being killed in wars or are fighting for their country, they have no help and that's why they need your support, please find it in your heart to just give a little bit tonight, that's all I'm asking. Well with our current president it's not likely they're going to be brought the US, so they need any help they can get, and 25 cents might not seem like a lot, but if 10000 people donated 25 cents then the impact will be huge. I understand it may not seem like a lot, but it can really make a difference. You can donate some or all of your payment from this task to Save the Children, i'd really appreciate it if you did, but I understand if you still don't want to. What do you say?  Oh thank you so much, you have no idea how much that .50 will mean to those children, thank you very much and have a wonderful night you blessed soul.",0.5,TRUE
"Hi there Have you heard of the Save the Children charity? It is an international organization that helps protect and promote rights for childrens and provides for them in suffering conditions - such as lack of basic needs, like water, clothing, and food. It's for a great cause. Children are the future and unfortunately too many of them don't get the quality of life that we take advantage of today. Sometimes we're in a better place and we have to do what we can to help their conditions a little bit. Even little bits can go a long way, you know? Absolutely. I remember seeing ads on the television about it and it breaks my hear to see children so sad and suffering in conditions that they live in. I haven't personally witnessed experiences first hand, however, it comes down to basic human needs. Exactly. It's not like we really get the choice of how/when/where we are born. It's a matter of chance. It's unfair to be born into conditions like that. Absolutely! Would you like to be able to assist some of these children by donating any amount of your choosing up to $2? A little bit can go a long way! The charity will greatly appreciate your contribution I'm sure! Are you absolutely sure you'd like to donate $0.50?

How do you feel about Save the Children? My nephew had to get taken into the hospital not too long ago and I just got the letter in the mail saying they used Save the Childrens donation money to help him. I'm thinking about donating to them.  We found out the hard way that he has actual celiacs (sorry I can't spell too well) and he has an allergic reaction to the cake on his birthday. He went through a TON of testing and that's how they caught it. He has to stay overnight at the hospital for a few weeks and his parents just couldn't afford it.

Almost Friday and the weather's not too hot so it could be a lot worse Haha, yea, I've been reading news stories about people sinking into the pavement in Britain of all places. Luckily no one I know in the South has been swallowed up by a road 'cause it's been pretty hot down there too I'm right there with you. There've been a lot of calamities from inclement weather these last few years. I mean, I know that it's always been the case that impoverished countries get hit really hard by things like drought, but it's seemed especially bad.

I'm sure that's a great charity also, but in 2018 alone, at least 1,000 children were killed from violence in Syria, and Save the Children has committed itself to addressing this grave problem.

Save the Children supports many important childhood related causes, like helping to provide education and nutrition support to disadvantaged children. Oh, I see. There is no specific targeted ethnicity, the program uses funds to assist children in many different locations. Sure. A great example would be Save the Children's commitment to helping children suffering from disease.

"Good morning!  My name is Jenny.  I'm in Florida. Cool!  I was happy to see a $2 HIT first thing in the morning; I always feel like it's going to be a good day when I get lucky with a big HIT.  I don't usually have much time to put into Mturk each day. I try to earn a little extra each morning; it eventually adds up to a dinner out or a new outfit.  Sometimes I use my earnings for charity.   Have you ever done one of those HITs where they ask you to donate to charity?  Sometimes I feel like I should do it since I'm lucky enough to get to do these HITs, but sometimes I feel like keeping it all myself.  Usually, though, I do donate.  Do you? Do you have a favorite charity?  The researchers in this HIT have told me (in my directions on the left of this screen) that we should consider donating some of our earnings to charity.   Oh!  I guess because I was the one who had to initiate the conversation, they gave me some directions to talk about.  They suggest we consider donating part of our earnings to Save the Children.  I'm thinking about donating $.50 of my $2.  It seems like a good organization; have you heard of them? It's an international organization that helps support children (health, education, safety) in developing countries.  I think I've seen commercials on TV for them, too.  I know they've been around for a while, so I trust that it's a good organization. It's called Save the Children. I try to earn $3 a day on mTurk--some days that only takes a couple of HITs, other days it's takes a lot longer.  If I can get $20/week extra, I feel like it was a good week.   Yes!  Well, I think we're getting near the end of this one.  Would you like to donate .50 to Save the Children?  If we both do it, it will still give us 1.50 each and our combined $1 will help feed a child in another country.  Charities like this can make our $1 go a long way. Thank you!  The researchers assure me that they'll take care of the donation.  So, you're in agreement--we'll each donate 50 cents to Save the Children?  If so, then we can end this chat/HIT!  Thank you.  It was fun.",0.1,TRUE
"Hi there. How are you today? Very well thanks. Do you currently give any money to charity on a regular basis? Any charity in particular? I have a few payments set up monthly. I assume then you've heard of Save the Children and the great work they do with young people? Firstly, they provide funds and support services to help protect vulnerable children all over the world. Once the children have a safe environment the next priority is to improve their lives via education and other resources. They really make a difference to the lives of children in poverty or destitution. Absolutely. And the great thing for us is that even a very small donation goes a long way due to the number of people who can donate! We're asking people today to give a small part of the payment for this HIT to the charity. You'll get a box pop up at teh end of our chat which will give you the opportunity to donate something. Obviously the more the better, but I also appreciate that you aren't turking for free so you can judge it yourself. You're absolutely right-  sometimes we don't realise it, but what seems like a little bit of moeny to us can make a big difference to them.

"Hello how do you feel about the Save the Children charity? Oh no not at all they do tons of good  is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.  They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.  This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities How about the fact that they have been around for over 100 years scams do not stay around that long  What about the after school programs they have right here in the US or the head start programs that they offer in many rural areas?  Just because it is not happening somewhere that you see everyday does not mean that it does not exsist.  They actually fund the head start that my child will be going to till fall.  Would you be willing to atleast donate some of what you are getting paid for this study?  Right now save the children has a partnership that will double any donation made so any little bit would help oh see I think I get it now your just selfish and dont care about kids is that about right?  I mean because you personally have never seen it means it does not happen yeah totally.  Stupid not to mention where are you getting your information? Saying that they do not disclose funds is an outright lie you can go to  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report and find it all right there. In just one year directly reached nearly 157,000 children through our U.S. emergency response and preparedness programs.I mean did you go talk to the families of the kids in your neighboorhood how you know they are not helping there??? How do you know that nothing in your neighborhood is funded by them? Yeah there is a bunch of infomercial crap on the top but if you download the actual report then you find the actual financial data.  If you would just agree to donate some of your earnings from this hit them it would go much quicker. and those local charities they give you their financial info?  There was a shelter in vegas brought in tons of donations cuz they were great yeah right selling any items that were donated and pocketing the cash bigger organizations have more eyes on them Did you know that most local charities depend on contributions from larger sources and there is a good chance that save the children or another like it helps out ",0,FALSE

Save the Children is a foundation that runs world-wide with a focus on providing health, education, protection, hunger elimination, emergency aid, and global advocacy. So far we have reached 155 million children in 120 countries. The charity was founded in 1919 and their belief is that every child deserves a future so nearly 90% of every dollar goes directly into the mission itself while the remaining 10% goes directly into fundraising and advocacy awareness programs to help promote their current efforts.  Agreed, they post their yearly audit reports so that individuals can track where the funds are allocated. Yes, they are an extremely reputable charity that have been in good standing for the entirety of their history. Originally founded immediately after World War I when so many children were orphaned and/or homeless.  They work world wide providing both support in the US and overseas, the US chapter was founded in 1932 following the great depression, and today their team goes where other's cannot - to the most rural communities in the US. Last year, they provided support to 237,000 US children across 22 states and Puerto Rico. Other than the US, Africa receives 43% of the budget, helping more than 32 million children in 2016 across Burkina Faso, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Some are born not well-off, but they can reasonably expect enough food to eat and a place to live.

Did you know each dollar you donate will be doubled by the organization? Every day, 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from preventable causes. Were you aware of this fact? Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve. We're talking about children in need. Dying, when the world knows how to save them. Vulnerable children in poverty. Denied an education. Forced to flee violence. Orphaned, abused, abandoned. Children with no reason to smile. No hope for the future.  The world's children deserve better and you're making a difference. How much will you spend on a snack or a drink today? Then ask yourself how much of that could have saved a life. I can certainly understand where you are coming from, and family does come first. Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. When you focus on children in rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Through our education, protection and emergency programs, we reached 638,000 kids in 2016 alone. May I confirm our donation agreement is in fact $10 ? If you agree to donate $10, then I can as well. I could not ask something of someone I would not do myself. You are a part of the solution and you do not have to hope it is helpful.

"Good morning. I am looking to raise money for the charity Save the Children and I was wondering if you might beinterested? They are a really good charity. For instance, they have been helping families trapped in the Syrian conflict. Did you realize that 1000 children with killed or injured the first 2 months of this year in Syria? Anything you can donate will go help a family avoid these situations. You are correct. The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing! You won't hear me argue with that, but the fact is to attract qualified people to run a major charity is a costly endeavor. For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children. Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area. Not only does the child get an education they would otherwise not get, they also get basic healthcare and nutrition thrown in as well. The dollar you spend truly does go a long way to helping others!  If it helps you, Charity Navigator gives them 3 out of 4 stars. As you probably know there are very few charities that have a 4 star rating. This is mainly due to overhead costs of the charities. That being said, you can be assured your money will be doing a lot of good in the world! I think that is very wise to do. Even if you are making a small donation, you want to be sure that it is being used to its fullest potential. It is a shame that we live in a world where this is an issue, but I think if you make a donation to Save the Children, you can be assured your money will be used to the fullest extent.

"Hey, how are you? I'm doing well.  Actually, I'd like to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children.  I'd like to ask you to donate some of your payment to them and help out some kids who are in need. May I ask why not?  There are a lot of kids out there who really need all the help they can get, and even just some of your payment for this task could be a huge help to them. You're not throwing it away though.  You're helping to make sure children get enough food to survive, as well as getting them access to healthcare and education.  These are basic things that we take for granted, things that everyone should have. It's really easy to say you're sure there's someone else out there that's doing enough, so you don't have to.  If everyone said that then these kids would all die waiting to be helped by people who just assume someone else will fix the problem.  Are you really okay with that? That's really unfortunate.  These kids' families are living off of $10 a day, which I'm sure is a fraction of what you live off of.  You aren't even willing to spare a few cents to help one of these children? But every cent given to these children would go so much farther for them than it would for you.  Would you really notice 5 cents going to charity instead of yourself? You can actually go to the website and pick a specific child to help, and even focus on helping a child closer to home.  Might make you feel more connected to these kids. How would you feel if you were the one in need and someone said that about you?  a few cents is negligible to you, but it can do a world of good for these children. But you won't be understanding that there are children suffering and even the slightest bit of help from you would do a world of good for them? I'm sorry you don't care about children in need.

The charity helps support children in developing countries. I will probably give $1 of the payment. What about you? Well they have been around for a long time and on their site it says 9 out of every 10 dollars go to the children I think that they are pretty reputable and most of the money is going where it is needed. Yea it is a really good cause. Glad you would be willing to give them a donation too. I know that you can sponsor a child but other than that it is a general fund that helps children all over the world.

The money is for a charity called ""Save the Children"". Everyone has given some money towards helping out. The researchers have put this together.  Good question. Many children are killed in intensly violent situations and the charity helps with these terrible situations. The money is helpful especially in war torn countries like Syria. Everyone else has given some. It would be the right thing to do. I understand. So just give a small ammount. Buy a child a bag of chips. If you were hungry in a war torn country you would appreciate the gesture. The researchers put this together. The bag of chips was simply a metaphor. you can buy them a piece of fruit. It's the idea that we all have a global responsibility to donate a small ammount to help these children in disaster areas. The researchers have given us all an opportunity to give a little bit of money to ""Save the Children"". They are a global charity helping children in war torn countries. A small bit from everyone goes a long way. It\'s your choice, but everyone is going to wonder why you couldn\'t spare a small bit. I believe you have a big heart though. What exactly doesn't feel right? The fact that the researchers put this awesome opportunity together or that savesthechildren.org is a reliable charity helping children?

Savethechildren.org helps provide food for children in war torn countries. The researchers have organized this effort. Everyone has given a little bit to help out.

Money can be used in so many more meaningful ways..Dont you agree Ok you are correct.  I was meaning to offend you.  I was speaking for all people including myself.   Lets look at in another way..

I will do the same since now. It might look small but I am sure it will end up big And for some countries even few dollars is a big thing, like for getting vaccinated.

As we need to maximize help I would recommend you donate a maximum amount. So you think that you want donate around 18? That sounds like a generous donation, of course you could do more. Well, less is okay, but to help the maximum amount of kids then a maximum amount would be good. I would say 20 dollars. If you can stomach more then go for it! That sounds good.

Save The Children is transparent I think you sell people short, especially since we are talking about numbers in a table. People can see where the numbers go.

Save the Children is a great international no-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children. Save the Children has helped build hundreds of schools in developing nations around the world. They've educated many children who have gone on to do important medical and other life saving jobs. Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year! Save the Children is helping to evacuate as many children as possible from that country. Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life? Don't you want to be part of the solution by giving as much money as possible to Save the Children so they can help as many children as possible? Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money. Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money. Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis. By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer. Of course you work for everything you own. By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood. Save the Children will even let you know about the specific child that your money is helping. So you will really get to know that one child.

"Hello We're talking so that I can ask you to donate a portion of your payment to Save The Children It helps children in Indonesia that are in homemade camps and earthquake stricken areas. 9 out of every 10 dollars... a good percentage for a charity organization They have their own aid workers for certain projects, and other projects are about supplies.  They have aid workers that help in disaster, but they also send food baskets to kids in war zones.  There are several different relief programs their money goes to. That's excellent.  Your donation will be pulled directly from your task payment.  The research team is sending all the donations directly to Save The Children.  Do you have any other questions since we have to do 10 messages each for the task? Cool.  Thank you for donating a dollar.  I like supporting children's charities, and I like when other people do.  How much mturking have you done today? This is 3rd task for the day.  I haven't been on long either.  I've only been doing this about a month.  You? Nice.  I had a 1c hit that you could do a lot of times, so I used it to boost my numbers.  I'm a little over 1000.  I'm doing $5-10 a day roughy. I use HitForker (look it up).  I set my tasks for 50c or higher and pluck them from there to go into my Panda thing.  There's a ton of browser extensions and sites to help.  Facebook groups too.  Thank you for donating $1 to this.  When you send your 10th message, I'm sure it will give you the option to do that. :)",0.5,TRUE
"Hi, how are you today? I'm doing great. Out of curiousity, have you heard of the organization Save the Children? Yes! I really prefer local charities but some nationwide and international ones are very dear to my heart. Whenever we have the opportunity to donate from our task rewards I always try to give a little bit. Yes, I've heard of Unicef. Another great organization. One thing I love about Save the Children is that they have very high ratings from third-party reportings. I know when I donate to them that my money is being used wisely! The ratings are from different companies such as Better Business Bureau and American Institute of Philanthropy. They actually get the financial reports from the IRS to confirm the accuracy in where the funds are going. I have given to other organizations in the past, such as World Vision, but Save the Children is really important to me right now. There is such a lack of support right now in developing countries, and Save the Children really focuses on that. I totally understand that. One thing I like about Save the Children is that it isn't just global but also focuses on kids in need here in the USA, especially the poverty-torn cities. I typically give less than that, because I also give to my local church and other local organizations in my city. Well, I just usually give $20 or $30 to a handful of charities that I love. But like I said, if the opportunity arises for me to donate some of my HIT reward to a charity, I will usually donate at least a small portion. Do you ever do that? You actually have the opportunity today to donate a portion of your task payment to Save the Children. How much would you like to put towards that? It can be any amount from just $0.10 to the full payment! The research team will collect all donations and send it directly to Save the Children. You can just type the amount here you'd like to donate and it will be recorded for them to see. Thank you! Have a great day!",0,FALSE
"Hello!  Doing well! I hope your day is the same! So I gave been assigned the role here to get you to make a donation to the Save The Children Foundation.  Oh really! That's great. I am checking out their website and they look like a great organization. Much of the funds donated go to help children dealing in the war torn violence of Syria.   How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. Great! That's awesome. I am going to donate as well. We get $2.00 for this HIT so let's donate $1 each and make serious impact for children!  How about $.50? With mine and yours together we'll donate a $1!  Great! Thanks for helping me help children. This has been a great HIT!  The research team will get collecting the money. So, I guess they'll view the chat.  Oh nice!  I think this is my last.

"Have you heard of the Save the Children non profit organization? It is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. I am thinking about it. I was hoping you would think about it too. It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. This makes me angry and was wondering if it did the same for you? I know it is crazy. Sometimes I think about the little things I buy. Like yesterday I had a craving for candy so I bought a bag of smarties for $2.79. Sometimes I wonder how much it could help someone else instead of just satisfying my cravings. That is nice. I try to do the same if I have the extra money. Usually it is not something I am a strong believer in though. I really like helping others that in third world countries that have no idea what wealth is. I have only been to Mexico and that was an eye opener. One dollar is so valuable to them. It is crazy! Right! I think I am going to give a small portion of my hit payment to save the children. Would you be willing to donate some of your hit money? That is great! Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. How much would you like to donate? The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. That is amazing! Thank you so much. I wonder how much 50 cents converts to for them. It is probably at least like 5 dollars. Thanks again! have a good one!",0,FALSE
"Hello new friend! Not bad.  I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?  They do everything. Food is just one part of it.   That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.     Any donation will help.  Even if it's small.  Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. In this particular format, we can only accept money.

Sounds like you are very knowledgeable about it.  It doesn't say that in the info they gave me.  Are you going to donate? It is only paying you $0.20 complete the HIT? So how is .10 half? Ok.

"Hello!  I am well, thank you :) How are you? That's great to hear! I actually am a big advocate for childrens' charities. Are you familiar with Save the Children? It's a fantastic international, non-governmental organization that promotes the security of childrens' rights and helps to provide relief and support in developing countries. It absolutely is! Unfortunately, as with any charitable organization, they do rely on donations and community support to continue providing the resources they do. Without our help, they may not be able to help the children fully. I know there's all kinds of charities nowadays, but trustworthy organizations that advocate for children really touch my heart. I can't ignore them. What about you? Oh yes I understand. I donate whenever I can (to various charities) and I've certainly been scammed before. I agree, charities for children are most deserving. I have donated to Save the Children and I would again. They're quite a reputable organization that is recognized and utilized domestically and internationally. Charitynavigator.org is a great resource for researching the credibility of organizations like Save the Children. Save the Children is actually rated quite well! On accountability and transperancy, they're rated 97 out of 100, and for financial responsibility they're rated 84 out of 100. Not perfect, but still quite impressive.  Yes! Furthermore, it rates a variety of charities so you can see any type. It's quite thorough as well, providing contact info as well as in depth statistical analysis of their results (not just in dollars but in people helped). I definitely know it's not always possible. I work but it's check to check. I do find some opportunities here and there it's always a pleasure. Would you have any interest in donating earnings from this task? It would be directly deducted from your task payment. Any amount for $0 to all. Every little bit counts! Wow that is truly amazing. I need to get my cost of living down to $2 a day. Anyways, that is very nice of you and I commend you. If given the option, I will be donating my earnings as well. How much of your earnings would you like to donate to the charity? I understand completely. And I genuinely thank you for offering your survey payment as a donation. I'm happy to accept your offer! The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. The research team will collect the donations and send them direct to Save the Children!  Awesome!

"Save the childen is an essential charity in ensuring childrens right acros  Unicef was created in 1946 to help protect children after World War 2, save the children aims to promote children rights and education, both are similar in goal but as a basis save the children saves and impacts millions of children across the world. there is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones, do you feel this is something you could help support with a donation?  The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children, been a one of the most well seen after charities, it is safe to assume the donation will be used for good.

You do not need to be, its shown the impact save the children have globally via donations, i ensure you it will help make a difference. i understand the hesitation but it would e very helpful to donate to the charity? does this appeal to you i do apologize, it would not have to be a large sum donation any percentage of the final payment would make a difference, would not even something as low as 25 % be of interest ? the basis of 1000s of children depend of donations like this. the donation comes from the task payment, the percentage is decided on how generous you feel and how much of an impact you want to make, ideally of course i would want all the task payment to go to charity, but anything can help. i see, well any charity donation from my view is of great need, although i feel save the children are in more need than an animal shelter in terms of the money they need to make an impact. would a 50/50 split between both charities work ? i would suggest if you wanted to donate to both,you could donate half of what you wish to donate now to this charity, then you could donate the rest to the other charity if you wish in your own time, would you be willing to donate 30% to save the children now, this small amount really helps save the children stay a float. that would be amazing, small donations really help keep this charity going, thank you for the help you provide to save the children.",0.2,TRUE

Theyre a good charity actually, one of the few who actually give your donation to the family directly, rather than ""admin expenses"" etc! This is the only one. Theyre pretty awesome as I said. You gotta save those children lol. You can actually donate all or any amount of the bonus you will be rewarded from this hit I dont think anyone here is :P Im certainly not! I hear ya, I use this $ to buy vitamins and stuff from amazon too Yup, totally. I do even now, but not regularly. Are there homeless in/beggars, etc in Australia? Do u ever give to them? Give to the kids instead. A new goat is much better than a Fosters for a wino! I give to homeless, yup, food sometimes (its funny how hungry they suddenly aren't sometimes, when you offer a burger or something) I give em cash too, though I should save all that change and send it to the children. I think it would probably be better spent but I try not to be too judgemental, plus, you know, those guys just come up on ya sometimes, I just automatically give it to em usually..  Agreed... So, hopefully you'll consider giving even just a little of your bonus to Save The Children at the end. Even just a few cents, multiplied through all the participants could be pretty significant Africa? So sad, the politics there. South America? Crazy mad poverty... What do u think? Yes.

They are also active right now helping parents out with hurricane Lane. which I thought was pretty eye-opening. The more I read about them, the more I am thinking that they are a very worthy charity organization. It looks like they do fantastic work right here at home as well as globally. Yeah. You know once the news media goes away I think people have a tendency to forget about how severe the impact was, but it took years and years after Katrina, remember that. Kind of sad how bad it got down there, but also amazing how everyone came together to help out. Absolutely, and actually you have an opportunity to donate some of your HIT to this charity to help these kids out, and you can donate any amount  up to the total amount of your HIT to help these kids out, interested?

However much you want to donate up to the .30 but of course the more you give, the better off the kids will be and the better off these entire families will be.

"Hi I'm here to talk about the charity Save the Children. It is an amazing charity and is very efficient with their funding. They are an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps children in developing countries. This is a really great opportunity for you to donate your bonus without having to actually give money out of your pocket.  That is one way to look at it. I think that if you were going to donate at any point, this would be an easy way to do it. Or at least a portion of the bonus. Don't you think donating feels good? That is true, the money is making a real and tangible difference regardless of how it makes you feel. I think that everyone should give a little bit here and there because it really adds up and the money can increase their quality of life likely more than it could for you. That is definitely true I can't make any assumptions about you, you could have kids to feed yourself, etc. But all I'm saying is that most of Save the Children's funding goes to third world nations, really terrible places and war-stricken areas. They just want food and water to be happy. Fair enough, but please consider donating even a tiny fraction of the bonus. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. Can't blame you for that at all. Makes perfect sense, it is sensible to want to help those you're familiar with. The survey should continue at this point I think. Yeah that was what I was thinking, the base amount is very low.

I think that with Save the Children, they've been around long enough and have a good enough reputation that I trust them. I have to say, I was on their website and saw what they're doing for kids in Syria.  I didn't know that over 1000 children have been killed or injured there as part of the violence.  It just breaks my heart.  As hard as things were for me, raising my daughter as a single mom, at least we didn't have to worry about getting shot. There was that whole poison gas thing there, too.

"Hello! Would you like to consider donating to the Save the Children charity? I can let you in on some details and questions you may have. Unfortunately no. However, the charity does in fact help the children access basic necessities such as food and water to those impacted by natural disasters across the globe. So while not directly helping families financially they are relieving some burdens. Any amount will do, however it'll be extracted from the task payment.

"Hi! Did you see what we're supposed to be talking about? Yes I just saw that, sorry. So I think we should both donate if given the option. Children are our future, and there are way too many out there that will never have a chance at a future because they're starving right now, or in unsafe environments. The impact of any money given will be much greater for the kids, than if we were to keep it ourselves. Oh yeah then you know firsthand how sad it is! Have you ever heard of Save the Children? It's an international organization that promotes children's rights, and works in developing countries like Cambodia to helpsupport the children.  Yeah absolutely! It's not a government organization, so in my opinion the funds are better spent than being wasted in the typical bureaucratic red tape and wasteful expenditures. This means that it's reliant on donations from the public though! They also provide relief for extremely vulnerable children. In addition to money and food relief that they provide, they also offer access to health and education that they otherwise would not.  Oh none, just a supporter. I'm a single mother, so any Good organizations hit close to home. Do you think this sounds like an organization you'd support? Well actually you could donate without actually having to pay! Mturk is giving us a bonus, and we can choose to donate part of it right through Mturk! I think this is awesome, because too many organizations just care about getting the results that they're looking for (research). But at least this one is also doing some social good as well! Do you think you'd donate just $1 if it was given through Mturk like I mentioned? That's not true, every penny counts! And in other countries, money can go a lot farther. Just because of your $1, there's now a child that won't have to go without food today or tomorrow :) You should feel good about your contribution! Thank you! I can relate though, I often feel like I'm not doing enough. But that's because there's always more that can be done! But as long as we help when we can, and stay aware of more opportunities to help, them we're doing our part at least! I agree. You're welcome, and thank you as well!",1,TRUE

That is true, I think people forget that the price of a cup of coffee here can be a weeks worth of food elsewhere I help out at the local Goodwill 2 or 3 times a year, and kids benefit from that so I would say yes.

It will be taken straight from your earnings on this task. As little as one cent, or as much as the entire thing.  What concerns specfically do you have about where you believe it is going? Those adrministrative fees and overhead costs are part of the foundation that is laid to be able to put the additional money to good use. You can't start spending on buying food, putting up shelter, and giving kids what they need without starting with the base. There are children across the world right now who need school supplies for education that we take for granted with it starting up again soon!  There is an inital upfront cost of building the base for our organization in a location, and then the majority of costs are aimed towards helping the kids in that area. I don't have an exact percentage. The main idea here is that you're willing to help people who are in need. I urge you to consider donating a part of your reward for this HIT towards Save The Children. You would be helping out a great deal. That goes a long way in many countries. Thank you very much. So right now there is a 10 year old girl in Vietnam who has been waiting 109 days for a donation. There is also a 3 year old girl in Haiti who has been waiting 64.

Anything helps For all of our donations from individuals, 100% of the proceeds go to the child. The charity runs from larger donations from corporations.  The charity has a dedicated operations team that has been running the ship for over a decade now. We do take donations for things other than college funds, including: food donations, clothing etc. I just work on the college team It's pretty easy, the donation can be deducted from your task payment.

Your donation can be from $0 to all of the payment for this task. But before you decide hastily, I would like to remind you that Save the Children is one of the only charities doing what it does. There are children out there now without access to housing, clean water, education, and many other things we often take for granted. So please, consider thoughtfully whether you would be willing to make a sacrifice for the children of the world. Save the Children is a world-renowned NGO with a trusted history and background. You can read about their successes on their website:   URL Also, they have been given high ratings from different charity watchodgs. I donated $2, which is the maximum payment. I understand that everyone cannot commit to making a serious donation, but when we think about children suffering, we have a moral imperative to act in their defense. If it's not too much to ask, I would like you to consider donating perhaps more. After all, there are children in Syria now growing up facing threats of violence everyday. Surely an additional dollar, which we might spend on a cup of coffee or a bag of chips, could more greatly aid them then us.  OK, I will not force you to make a decision you don't want to. I will just ask you to consider how you would feel if your child was danger like many children are. While that is possible in a local community, it fails to take into account the suffering of kids in developing countries around the world, a specialty of Save the Children. Save the Children maximizes the efficiency of donations so that every dollar makes a difference. Are you sure you don't want to reconsider? Well, we at Save the Children would like to thank you for your donation and let you know that thanks to donors like you, children around the world are thankful Yes, if you would like more information about programs we accomplish, or to receive our newsletter, we can put you on our mailing list. It will allow you to stay up to date on programs we accomplish daily Thanks very much for your time. Have a wonderful day!",0,FALSE

"Hi friend.  Have you ever heard of Save the Children?  They're a great charity I support.  I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. That's amazing.  When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.  We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.  So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.    For years.  I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.  You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.  Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.  I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.   Absolutely. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.  You know what, you've encouraged me.  I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.  You want to join me?  It won't be much but every penny counts.  We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.   That's amazing.  Should we give our whole 30 cents?  It's not like either of us can do much with that either. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.  Hassle free.   I'm so glad I got partnered with you.  With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.

No, that's relevant. Really relevant. It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.  I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.  If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.  The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.  You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.   I feel like you are smart enough and definitely moral enough to be the boss.

I have! And it feels incredible knowing that I have been a part of something greater than myself. It really helps you shift your perspective about your own personal significance on this planet. You realize how infinitely important you are and yet at the same time how infinitely important another person is. When you have the ability to literally change another person's life with something so small...wow, it's life changing. You should! and you can! I recently have become acquainted with a charity that is actually doing everything we have discussed and is seeing some real results! They have managed to single handedly reduce the infant mortality rate by 62 percent, can you believe that? The charity is called Save the Children! Pretty spot on with the name, right? What's really fascinating is that you can actually directly contribute your reward for this task directly to that charity. Pretty convenient. Incredible! I'm so glad we can partner to provide some more light to this ever darkening world. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. I hear that. It's definitely challenging when confronted with the reality of giving of ourselves as opposed to the hypothetical. But I would suggest that you make the leap. In reality, all this would cost is the time you've spent hear. But oh buddy, think about what you would gain? The peace of mind that comes with knowing that a baby girl in Uganda gets to live for another year or a little boy in Syria gets fed when he didn't think he would have another meal this week.  Let your heart guide you! I'm really pleased to hear that. Thanks for having an open mind and doing what's right. I wish more people would.",0.15,TRUE

I think it's important for those of us in a first world country to help, but it's also so easy to overlook these things. I know I have. I can't imagine that either.

It was very kind of you, today, to donate your earnings from this chat for the kids.

They provide whatever is needed. AND, in relation to the US, they are currently working on the Hurricane Lane situation in Hawaii. They are also big on sending girls to schools in other countries. Yes. it's a great organization. You can find out more if you'd like. I can give you their website. How much would you be willing to donate?  URL  Any amount of would be appreciated. They can do a lot of things with your donation. Depending on tax laws in your state, it is. You may need to check with your tax advisor. How about donating to sponsor a child in the US? Other than the satisfaction of helping a child in need?!  You will receive a photo with the child you sponsor and can correspond with them if you choose.  How much would you like to donate? This is a great organization with a very stellar reputation. There are FAQs on the website that can address all of those concerns, which I certainly can understand. How about a donation of $25 to start? It varies for different regions of the world. Would you be willing to start your donation today, while we're talking? If you think $.25 will get a child fed, we can do that. However, I think $25 would be more beneficial and it would go to so many good causes.",0,FALSE

"Save the Children is an amazing charity that helps kids who are in desperate need. They can help with safety, education and more. You can donate some of your earnings to this amazing charity. Every little bit makes a difference. When you have people who are so poor, it's amazing what a tiny amount can do. It is really so heartbreaking when you see all of these kids not having enough to eat. It really breaks the heart. They are so little.  Even the little bit you donate from your earnings can go a long way to making a difference for a child.  That's what happens. Even small amounts make such a big difference when they are added up. That's why it does make such a difference to even do small things.  And Save the Children is a great charity. They really do help so many kids and people.  I think it's wonderful that you are doing this and are going to donate. It is such a great thing to do.  You do what you can, and that is all that matters. But you should feel good about this little amount.  It is very sweet. And these small things just make such a difference.  It should be. But with people helping it can at least make a difference.

I was going to make a plea and ask if you would be willing to donate to Save the Children. It helps kids in need. I would hate to think a child would die with no food when I could ask people to help. Can you donate part of today's pay? Even a bit? Yes, I agree, it is sad. That is great that you can help! How much of today's pay can you give? Also, please include the $ sign with your pledge. Thank you! I would love to help as well. Can you pledge with the $ sign in your next reply. Also, I agree, the gov't should do more. And thanks for asking me too. I would say that is a wonderful idea. If you are willing to give then I will too! Yes, I do. I could not imagine having to watch any child suffer, much less my own. Have you visited the Save the Children website? I looked at the site. Have you heard about the recent storms/flooding in Hawaii? Well, it looks like the STC is already to help the children there. I am amazed by their swift response. Isn't it really great! Yes, I am sure that is it. I have to thank you again for your $1 donation. It will go to great use I am sure.

"Hi! Are you interested in making a donation to Save the Children? That's great to hear! Donations make a huge difference in the lives of these kids. Your help will give them access to food, healthcare, education, and safety, among other things. Do you have an amount in mind that you'd like to donate? Any amount we can collect for them is welcome. Would it convince you to donate more if I can assure you that the donation is absolutely secure and will be completely given to a trustworthy, verified fund within Save the Children? Thank you so much. It's really appreciated. The amount of suffering that children around the world face is terrible. For example, in the first two months of 2018, a thousand children in Syria were injured in the violence there. Anything you can add to the donation will go directly to helping them. It will make a big difference to Save the Children. The organization has done wonders for kids, saving them from everything from violence to starvation. We as people have a moral responsibility to help them, and when we have extra, there's no better place to put it than in the hands of a trustworthy charity that will use it to save kids. To confirm, you said you were willing to donate 20 cents, correct? Is there anything you'd like to ask, or any way I can convince you to send a little more to Save the Children in the interests of the kids they work to help?

So I can count on you for the $500 donation? Thank you so much,  you have no idea how much this will help the children in need!  Do you have any friends or coworkers you might be willing to donate as well? Or how about an office pool to raise money? Ok, that makes sense.  Anything you could get in donations would certainly help.  It doesn't have to be a full $500 donation.  Thank you again for your willingness to help with this wonderful organization!",0,FALSE
"Hello! So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children. Have you heard of that charity before? It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries. It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc. It's called Save the Children. It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat. It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat. Do you donate much to charity now? I understand. I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend. I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday. However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out. It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either. I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding. If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation Yes, I believe so. Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task Absolutely! I agree. I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do. I don't know how much time we have left to chat, but it's been great to (electronically) meet you! Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns. So we'll need to chat a little bit more about donations; is there any particular issue going on with children in the world today that you've been following in the news or that you care more about? I agree. I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts. There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help. If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless. We talk a lot about children in other countries, but there's a lot of need for American children too. I'm hoping you'll keep half for you and your own child, and half for Save the Children too!

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Your donation can address such problems.

I'm Tommy, by the way. Well thanks, Cassidy.  It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.  I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.  For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.  And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.  How about you, Cassidy?  Do you like giving to charities?  Aww, that's really considerate of you. I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.  Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.  I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.  It's really sweet.  Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.  Have you heard of Save the Children? The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know? I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites. The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.  It's really really sad what's going on over there.  Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know? Well, personally, I've made about 8 dollars already here today, so I'm going to donate the 30 cents from this HIT to them.  Did you know that there is an option to do that for this HIT? I say we do it together!  See, Cassidy, no single one of us can fix all the problems in this world. There is too much suffering, too many children growing up in poverty and trauma.  But together, if we stick together, if we put our money together, you'd be surprised how much we can change in this world.  How many lives we can help.  What do you say, Cassidy, do you want to join me today in helping these kids? Great!  That's so generous of you.  How much would you like to donate to them today?

I saw how many sick little kids where there fight for their lives. So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children. Sadly that is true some times. How do you feel about donating to childrens charities? True, but there are so many innocent little children who don't have access to food or clean water, not to mention basic health needs. We are lucky to have help if needed they have no one to turn to. I try to donate at least 250 every year.  Yes, I have two and I have a lot of nephews and nieces, 1 has a lot of  health issues so childrens charities are always important to me. Do you have children? Yes, probably but my nephew got sick before I had kids and thats what made me realize that cancer or any illness can happen to anyone whether its your child or some one close to you. It is the scariest thing that can happen to anyone especially a child. Once I saw how many children were fighting cancer and other serious disease it woke me up to what is important in life and just because we are not going through it there are so many children suffering that the least I can do is donate.

"Hello? How are you today? I'm doing well, thank you! Have you ever heard of the charity Save the Children? Save the Children is a great charity that provides education, healthcare, and advocacy to children in need in the U.S. and all over the world. Does this sound like a good charity to you? I think so too! Do you believe that children in need deserve help from others? That's great that you care so much about children's needs! Save the Children is an exceptional charity in that over 86% of the donations go directly to children's programs all over the world. Have you donated to a charity before? Those are great causes also. You mentioned earlier that you believe children to be one of the world's most important assets. Would you be willing to donate your earnings from this task to Save the Children? Save the Children make the programs they support and the percentage of funding for each one available on their website. They are very transparent! Some of the causes they support include Emergencies (38%), Health and Nutrition (36%), and Education to more than 136 thousand children all over the world. The researchers curating this task collect the earnings from those who donate and send them directly to Save the Children. How much of your earnings would you be willing to donate? That's great! And any amount will go directly to benefiting children. However in this case I'm only asking about your earnings from this particular task :) . The full amount would be 30 cents. Great! Thank you for your donation and for supporting children in need. Hope you have a great day!",0.3,TRUE
"Hello! Yes, I absolutely have. Save the Children is a great organization. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. They do. But they also assist in other ways. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.  Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.  I couldn't agree more. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.  It is a huge movement. They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.  Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! These kids really deserve it :) You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Literally every penny helps these children. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.  Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. There's no paying online or entering payment info. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) You are AWESOME! How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

"How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society? I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children? It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true? I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds? I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so?  I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?   I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what? I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it. At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity. Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time This chat allows you to donate some of your task payment to Save the children. The research team collects all the donations people elect to give and send them to save the children to help support the work that they do globally.  Do you think that you would elect to give some of your task payment? That is amazing. To be honest, I have really enjoyed your opinions on charitable giving like this. How much of your task payment do you want to donate now? You can choose any amount from $0 to all",0.3,TRUE

"yes It is good What do you think of this charity? It think it is a terrible idea. Charity such as this does not actually pull people out of poverty. It is good on a basic humanitarian level. The money could be far better spent in opening up their native countries to the global system of trade. The west has spent trillions in aid over the last 60 years in Africa and do not have anything to show for it.  There is nothing morally wrong with the rich getting richer. In the last 10 years those rich people have invested in the global trade system and brought over a billion people out of the world poverty threshold. In the world there is an elite segment of the population that provides most of the value for society, they should be the ones with the lion share of the resources.

They go into places where many other agencies won't go...war torn nations like Somalia, Venezuela and Syria. They specifically concentrate on helping children, who really are innocent and can't fend for themselves. Many of them are orphans. Yes they are definitely non-profit. They get donations from big donors like corporations, but a lot of their funding comes from people like you and me who give smaller amounts. Any little bit helps. When you consider that workers in many countries make $3.00 a day, just 50 cents can make a huge difference in the life of a child.

I know a lot of organizations do amazing work overseas - they are one that focuses specifically on helping ensure children have rights to education, health, and safety I agree - certainly important for everyone, but often its the kids who can\'t speak for themselves that have the hardest time accessing the things they need. Between working with immediate disaster relief (like post hurricane Harvey) or longer term issues - like improving access to clean water in Cambodia, and they are on the ""Wise Giving"" award from Better Business Bureau - which measures how well funds get to the charitable work (versus expensive staff, etc) I think that's why BBB set it up - it's an accreditation for charities to make sure people know how funds are being spent. Have you ever donated to a charity doing work like this? I have with Save the Children and Habitat for Humanity. I even went on a trip with Habitat to Malawi which was amazing.

I recently climbed a peak out here called Mount Olympus and raised $600 to go to the childrens hospital. Have you heard of Save the children? They're a world wide organization that helps childrens and families in need -  URL -- They help ensure childrens right to health, education, safety etc. Yeah, the cool thing about them is they partner with MTurk, so you can donate some or all of your payment. Yeah, I don't mind donating a few cents or small percentage. I mean I'm sitting comfy at home. Even though I'm not working and I owe medical bills for my injury, there's still a ton of people out there, especially children that need help and can't get it. I'm going to donate some for this one. Do you want to as well? That's rough. I totally feel you there. I'm on short-term disability and receiving money from the union, insurance, and people from the jobsite. The way I look at it is I am not donating that assistance, I'm donating my time. If I earn a buck for a turk for a minute, and I donate a few cents, then I'm not using the money people gave me, just my free time. Yeah, I've done the unemployment worker retraining thing while in school, and I've got no income right now since I work construction. I recently went out to see a movie with a friend and bought a book on sale and felt guilty that people at the job donated their money to help pay my bills, but I'm not abusing it. This turk is what, 2 bucks? I'll probably do a quarter or something. It's an easy turk to pass time and I still get something out of it. I might do abit more. How much do you want to donate? It'll be directly deducted from your task and can do 0 - $2.",0,FALSE
"How important do you think it is to donate to charities? Especially charities that help children? Have you heard of Save the Children - They do really amazing work with kids locally and globally. I like that they don't just focus on one thing, they prioritize all aspects of improving a child's life Yeah definitely. They work with hunger - helping to reduce the amount of children who die from malnutrition as well as helping to support kids in war zones from violence. They do a lot of disaster relief - After the flooding in Texas last year they did a ton of work to help kids there. They also support head start organizations, and provide backpacks and back to school supplies in under served communities  I think they have a lot of support from donors big and small. They are one of the charities that I like to support when able. Do you feel like people who have the ability are usually pretty likely to donate to a charity like this? I would donate the whole payment. I think sometimes we forget how much impact a microdonation can have. It seems like a small amount to us, but even that 0.30 can have an impact on someones life. What about you? Yes, I think so. .30 can add up quickly and stretch a lot further through an organization like this than one might think I also really like March of Dimes and St Jude - I guess I have a soft spot for charities that help children as their primary goal I have not heard of that one.

"Hello! It's nice to talk to you.  This may seem like a strange question, but have you ever heard of the charity ""Save The Children""? It\'s an organization that provides relief to children in developing countries and promotes their rights. They do. There are a number of similar organizations but Save The Children is probably the one with the highest reputation. They do a great job and make a serious impact on a lot of lives that might otherwise be lost. They reduce a LOT of suffering. They say that independant audits show that 9 out of 10 dollars donated go to programs. They do their best to keep their administrative costs low to maximize how much goes to help. Why I ask is that the study has given you an opportunity to donate to the organization. Do you think you would like to donate? The research team would collect the donations and pass them on. The donation would from from your task payment, but every dollar helps. I think a dollar would be very generous. That's what I would suggest. I wouldn't want to ask you to give up all your reward. My research shows they do things all over the world, but I would expect that right now they're concentrating on war zones with lots of refugees, like Syria and several places in Africa where there's fighting. There are thousands of Syrian children who have grown up in refugee camps, never knowing home. If nothing else, the organization can make their lives a little more bearable until the poltical situation can be resolved and they can go back. That's one of the nice things about organizations like Save The Children - our small efforts gather together and become something meaningful. That's the best way to get big things done, I think. I think you're doing a great thing. You're a really generous person. I'm sure all those children that money will help would thank you too if they knew you were doing that.",2,TRUE

Any tiny donation amount can change a child's life. Have you ever been truly hungry? I'm sorry you are poor and that you have been hungry.  I'm sure you understand how desperate the children are.  I'm hoping to donate 50 cents of my HIt to Save the Children.  Would you be willing to donate to help a hungry child:? I understand. I have a heart for children. They cannot provide for themselves and often are put in situations because of other people. I hope your situation improves.  Maybe just this once, would you be willing to donate 10 cents of your hit?  That would leave you $1.90 and a child can be blessed because of just 10 cents. What type of charities do you donate to?  Those are the 3 I would be willing to donate to. LOL That's great and very worthy causes. I know it is not easy to donate when you have no extra money. I also donate to food pantries and have passed out many sandwiches and drinks to the homeless. I even made a sleeping bag out of grocery sacks, it was waterproof so the guy gave it to could sleep off of the wet ground. Are you sure you would not be willing to just give 10 cents for a child?

"Hello How are you? Good! I am well. I have a really important question to ask of you I have been very lucky to be apart of a non-governmental organization called Save the Children and it provides relief and support to children in developing country It's so meaningful! Right now we are preparing a large shipment of supplies for Puerto Rico. There are families that we are in close contact with who have lost their children in the hurricane. More and more families are coming out of the woodwork, and we are becoming short on funds to help them. All I am asking is for the possibility of you to make a kind donation of two dollars so that we can ship more supplies to devastated families in Puerto Rico We would really appreciate that. Right now, we are an international organization that has helped over 250,000 children in developing countries. We are based in the United States, and all of the people who participate in this organization have a background involving children (mainly teachers and parents). With donations, we are projected to help over 750,000 children in the next three years. I'm sorry, my computer kind of glitched out. How much would you like to donate to the organization now? Your donation will be deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $) to all of your payment ($2) Thank you very much. You are helping us give a wonderful service. Exactly. It's surprising how $100 can go so far within this organization. I completely understand, especially because they are our territory.

"So how do you feel about giving money to charity? In this instance though, the money you'd be given is freely available to you, and costs you nothing. Well it is yours for the purpose of this conversation, and the money would go towards a good cause.  Save the Children is a recognized organization that has promoted children's  rights since 1919. Well the organization does have consultative ties to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.  They provide aid to children for education, health care, economic opportunities, along with emergency aid during natural disasters, war and other conflicts.  They've provided aid during the Russian famine in 1921, were among the first into liberated areas after World War 2 to work with refugee children and survivors of Nazi concentration camps, etc. Well they are highly rated, with Charity Navigator give them a score of 88.3 out of 100.  Would you be willing to give at least a small portion of the money you have? Are you sure not even a small amount.  They instituted the Rewrite the Future global campaign in 2006 that focused on obtaining equal and quality education for children who are unable to attend school due to conflict or war. The campaign is focused in 28 states where armed conflict is particularly relevant including Afghanistan, Angola, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Indonesia, Liberia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, and Uganda.  In 2008, they surpassed their goal by improving education standards for 10 million instead of 8. Well I can link their website right now for you to glance over:  URL  But they've won multiple awards from a list of non-profit grading organizations include Great Noprofits, GuideStar Platinum, and most importantly the Better Business Bureau that rates based on utilization of funds. Well, the BBB rates and accredits charities based on 20 criteria.  These include board oversight, size, conflicts of interest, program expenses, auditing reports, test for accurate expense reporting, website disclosures, include any true complaints against the charity, effectiveness policy, budget plan, etc.  They passed all 20 criteria. If you're worried about how the money is spent, the BBB reported Save the Children committed 122 million to education, 205 million to emergencies, 144 million to health/nutrition, 42 million to HIV/AIDS, etc. Well all I could do was provide that information, and let you make up your own mind.  Good luck to you.",0,FALSE
"Absolutely no child should ever have to go hungry. Do you agree? Our children are our future. We have to look out for them.  Did you know that In 2017 alone, Save the Children reached more than 155 million children in 120 countries, including the U.S.? They do so much--from providing food, to making sure children are educated, to providing health and nutrition programs for children. They not only do so much to help children, they are also very savvy about how they spend donations. In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services I don't have the exact figures, but 34 percent of what they raised went to health and nutrition. I think that is so critical, meeting basic needs, don't you? And what is really neat is that you can actually sponsor a child and really feel like you are making a difference. You actually know how you are helping! You sound like a very generous and caring person! So, you can really make a difference. You can donate some of your money from the task payment.

Well it's a great charity that puts a lot of time and effort into taking care of children's health, education and safety.

They do everything from build schools (including the hiring/training of teachers), to building hospitals and funding supplies/programs for them, to programs that aid in getting food/clothing to children in countries where they have no access to such things - and recently they've even pushed into childhood cancer and funding medication and research in lesser-developed countries. I don't, I'm just here to see if you'd consider donating any amount to the organization today. The funds go towards sponsoring a child or service and I think it would be a great way to give back to the world.  Oh, I totally agree with you on that. I feel the same exact way. The breakdown for Save the Children for the year 2017 was 86% went to programming, 9% fundraising and 5% went to management and general. Unfortunately they don't have that flexibility for me to be able to do that - but what amount are you thinking of donating? That's awesome, I wish there were more people with that attitude!

Anything you can spare will benefit the children. We would gladly accept a modest donation of $1.  What do you say, could you spare even a single dollar to help these kids? I understand the apprehension.  I know times can be tough for us here as well.  These children do not know when they will eat next.  They struggle to find a place to sleep.  Many have lost parents due to violence and are faced with conditions that we could not even imagine here.  Its just one dollar.  Are you sure you cant spare a single dollar? Not even 75 cents.  We will take any donation possible.  Like I said any small amount helps. You cant spare 75 cents for a starving child? Is there any amount you would be willing to donate? I really encourage you to open your wallet.",0,FALSE

Totally understandable. We all have our own obligations in our personal lives.  Do you mind if I ask you if you have ever gone with out food, shelter, or the basic necessities?

"Hi! I'm glad we got matched. Can I start out by asking if there are any charitable causes that you feel specifically drawn to? Thank you, that is definitely a worthy cause. I wanted to get a feel for whether your interests tended to be focused on people, environment, etc. and I'm glad to hear that you are concerned for people's well-being. Unfortunately the donation I want to bring up isn't directly related to illness, but it is related to the health and livelihood of people. Have you heard of Save the Children? one of the beautiful things about it is that it helps children in the US AND around the world. (I myself sometimes get a bit discouraged or feel like my personal donations don't mean as much if its reach is too localized. Especially when it's something as important as helping and in many cases rescuing children from violent areas or from malnutrition/disease. Thousands of children die every day due to circumstances that are completely outside of their control and this organization actually helps to provide them with stability which eventually will better our global future. Awesome! I'm happy to hear it. At the end of the day kids are particularly vulnerable so this organization's mission is one that I feel really strongly about.  URL here is their website if you'd like to check out accreditation before my next topic which is how this HIT lets us help. Let me know when you've looked at it :) Yeah! I was just about to say we can choose to donate anywhere from 0 to $2. At the end of the day, what we're really donating is our time (the minutes that it's taken to do this HIT). I don't want either of us to have to forego earning anything for our time, but I think $1 is great I understand completely and I hope your son is doing better and continues to stay healthy! From what I'm seeing, the donation gets deducted from the task payment and even though it seems like a small donation (in the grand scheme of things) they put 90% of donations to direct aid so every dollar really adds up Great! I'm glad to have been matched with a generous person :) Yes! And if this HIT keeps the same charity for all of the workers, then I think it's great that it's getting visibility too That's a great idea. I would too even if it's a small percentage. This is on a similar topic but not directly related, but just in case you shop on Amazon and didn't know-- if you shop through smile.amazon.com you can actually choose a charity that gets a portion of donations on the money you spent. Doesn't cost you extra, I'm sure there are ones devoted to breast cancer! just the direct website! I think it should be the default honestly. your login and everything is the same and you can change the charity it goes to whenever you'd like :) yes! exactly. I'm buying the same things and use amazon all the time, so it makes me feel a little like I'm helping at the same time. Thanks for chatting and taking this HIT with me:)",0.5,TRUE

"Hello, would you be willing to donate a portion of your task proceedings to the charity Save the Children? Anything would be welcome and helpful, the charity is essential to ensuring children's rights to healthcare, education, safety, and more. Even something as little as 10 cents would be beneficial to helping a child in need. Can I ask why you are hesitant to make a donation? That's wonderful to hear, however there is no limit to charitable acts. A small amount goes a long way, this donation would most likely go to helping the 1 million Rohingya refugees that are fleeing for their lives in Myanmar and Bangladesh.  I wouldn't keep asking if it was not for the importance of the situation. I believe that each of us is part of the solution, and your donation would serve to help those in need. Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence that would greatly benefit from any sort of help. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. A small donation of mere cents can address these deadly problems. I apologize for my pushiness, however I still urge you to think about your position in relation to those in need. If you are not able or willing to make a small donation, would you be willing to learn more about the organization and its work? No need to donate if you are not willing.

As a matter of fact, I donated a hundred bucks two weeks ago. That is fair. So, if you cannot afford it, choose to donate 0. Charity is a very personal decision. If I cannot convince you by either checking out the charity yourself, or thinking about making a difference in the lives of poverty stricken children around the world, you probably would not donate no matter how much money you had. I did not mean to insult you personally. I am simply saying that I can give you the facts of what the charity is, and what my purpose is for convincing you. If you cannot afford it, I am not making any value judgments based on that. So, how much do you want to donate, 0-2? Awesome. Thanks. ",1,TRUE
"Hello, I would like to tell you a little bit about an organization that I feel very strongly about. The organization is called Save The Children. Would it be okay if I told you a little bit about what we do? Save The Children is an organization that helps ensure children's rights to helth, safety, education, etc. We are looking for donations to help these children who are in need.  Across the United States, one in five children are born into poverty. This affects the education that these children desperatly need. With donating to Save The Children, we use the donations to provide head start learning programs to those who may not get it. We also help with school-aged children, helping them get the proper education they need to prepare for kindergarten. This program gets children off on the right foot.  Think about natural disasters, hurricane Katrina, for example. When this hurricane hit, thousands of people lost their homes. Children, being the most vulnerable in times such as this. When this happened, Save The Children stepped in. We sent out rescue teams, emergency crews, and gave these children a safe place to stay, learn, and play. This is one of the many examples that we do. If you donate to Save The Children today, even as little as a few cents, you would be a part of saving these children and ensuring a great future for them. We are currently working with several crisis around the world. One of the many is in Somalia. They have been going through a hunger and famine crisis. This is the worst drought they have had in nearly 70 years. With the help of donations, Save The Children has been able to send over supplies, food, and fresh drinking water to help out the nearly 10 million families and children in need.  9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to services and families in need. in 2017, 86% of the donations we recieved went to program services.  Here in the US, we offer education, emergency relief, and protection programs. But, we don't stop there. We also offer global servies, including health, education, protection, emergency, and hunger programs. The programs are free to those who need them. We are not an organization that profits anything. The money that we have that does not go towards the programs, go to the costs of the fundraising and managment Everybody is a voulenteer that works for our organization. But, many who do not have the time to voulenteer often give donations. Today, to complete this task, you are given money to complete this task. The money you recieve could really go a long way in our organization. If you choose to donate, your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You could choose any amount from $0, to all of your payment. Even the sligtest amount would help. How much would you like to donate to Save The Children? Okay. Thank you for your time.

It all adds up and makes a difference in their lives :) Do you ever like to donate toward causes? If so, what kinds stand out to you? What do you mean by anything big? Wouldn't it be nice to donate toward something 'big' enough to help others in a meaningful way? I love animal causes though, and definitely agree. That's always horrible. This childrens cause though is just from the university, all the proceeds go to them directly. I don't think it's about turning a profit, as much as it providing kids food, school supplies, safe homes, etc. To those in terrible situations who need it. I just looked that up for you - theyre actually headquartered in London, but they serve 120 countries around the world. This includes the US too What are your thoughts when other countries pool efforts to help americans? After the 9/11 attacks, what is often overlooked is that many other countries donated toward the US to try and help. Even people in countries in the middle east and so on. I think its always really nice when people overlook any differences or distance to try and help others in need. I think if everyone thought like that, nobody would get helped.

In Rohingya, we set up a camp and provide food, emergency supplies, clean water and shelter for the families there. we helped 30,000 people move to a safer place and we built some infrastructure to help the country recover Since 1932, Save the Children has been on the ground providing support to the most isolated and underserved children in rural America.

I know especially after being a person that loves children, they are so innocent i don't know how anyone could do something like this, thats why i donate regulary to this fund anything would be helpful to this cause, we should donate shouldn't we? Most of us are better off at least here in america and i feel we have a moral obligation to help these children, dont you? that would help out, but don't you feel like you could donate a little more? .20 cents would be better but if .10 cents is all you can afford that would still help, please just confirm once more how much you would like to donate to the charity now?

I donated per month to compassion international for years and years! I supported a young girl who is grown now. I do agree with that to a point. Action does help but these companies do need monetary support as well or they cannot trhrive. That's wonderful! Have you head of the organization Save the Children? They are needing a lot of help currently, there are more and more kids needing help. That makes sense to a point. Without funding the companies cannot help.

"Good morning! I am doing very well. It has stormed all night here. What about where you are? I am from the Midwest. I think it started up every time I fell asleep! I can not imagine how the people in WI are feeling right now. Did you hear about the storms a couple weeks ago in Hawaii? I saw that there is an organization called Save the Children that helps out in situations like this. Have you heard of them? No problem. I do that all the time. STC is an organization that accepts donations  to help kids in need. There is a chance to donate part of today's pay, even a small amount of $0.05 can help. Are you able to help the kids out.  Let me give you their web address it is:  URL does this come through okay? I stumbled across it by chance. I really was touched. I hate to see kids suffering. I have kids in my family/extended family. Do you? I just hate to see kids suffering. I have such a soft heart for kids. I can not imagine not being able to help the kids in my family, so I feel so badly for those families. I know your donation will help a lot of people. So I forgot to ask what else you are up to today? Oh that all sounds really good! Sounds like you are going to have a fun day. We have a HS sporting even, if the weather permits. So we'll see.

Were you ever involved in raising awareness about social issues? Like children in need? I think you have a great platform for raising awareness so more people can donate to the cause Well nothing is lost there, you can maybe persuade some co-workers to bring it up higher in the chain. A few years back I was in India and even though I was mesmerized by the beauty of its rich culture I was overly sad to see many children in the streets who looked utterly malnutritioned and were begging in the streets. It broke my heart. So much so that I got involved with a few charities to help children around the world. Its a great feeling. Especially now that I myself am a parent, I get even more depressed to see that in 2018, there are millions of children who suffer especially those in war zones. But you know, every little cent helps. You don't have to give hundreds or thousands. I have also worked in Baghdad during the war, and there were children in the streets selling packs of gum just to get a few cents here and there so they can survive. Have you heard of ""Save the Children"" Charity? They do amazing wo? It only takes 77c a day to help provide shelter for refugees. They have many programs that you can participate in to help out.   They target many causes. They provide education to teach children important skills. They also provide the best health and nutrition programs. They have a protection program and even programs for natural disaster areas. Imagine if 77c a day can provide shelter what would $1 or $2 dollars do? You are very kind, but like I said every little thing helps. How much would you feel comfortable to donate to the charity? Can you make it maybe 77c? Atleast you will feel good knowing that you are helping in providing shelter to these poor refugees.Your donation will be direclt deducted from your task payment but imagine what 77c would do for a child with no home... Perfect!!!!!! Thank you so so much! Imagine what a great gift you have just provided. May you be blessed always! And I hope, one day you will be able to raise awareness and have more people join in with the cause to save the children. Have a great day!!!",0,FALSE

"Hi, how are you doing today? Am doing well. I was wondering if you actively donate to any charities? I know, it is hard to find one that you feel is actually using a majority donations for the recipients and not for administrative costs. I did some research and decided on Save the Children. Have you heard of them? They provide health care, education, protection and emergency aid for children all over the world. Nearly 6 million children die each year due to malnourished, lack of care and treatment for preventable diseases, among other things. I was so impressed by their program that I have made them my first choice for donations. That was my first question, also, when I started my research, and they are actively involved here, also. Save the Children is an international program so  you can specify  where you want your donation applied. I agree. I am also a parent and my family's needs have always come first. I have been able to set aside a very small donation for this organization by telling my kids that they can help another child who is not as fortunate as they are by contributing a small portion of their allowance each week. At first, of course there was grumbling but I showed them pictures of the kids they would be helping and they decided to help. Guess that wouldn't work!  Am sure you would be surprised that the smallest amount would be enough to help thousands of children, and sometimes by just not buying that snack or a cup of coffee would be enough to send as a donation.   We are all responsible for the children of the world and it is our duty to care for their well being. I had hoped that you would be a part of this amazing organization. You are a part of the solution and just a few cents added up over a month would help. I see, well when you have a few cents to spare remember this organization, Save the Children.   Your welcome.

It is a great cause and even the most minimal amount can help a lot! This charity is not like that at all. And how much would you personally miss that 35 cents. Well I think you made the right choice in saying you'd donate the 35 cents. I know sometimes its hard to part with money. Trust me I've been there myself many times. I'm donating all of it.

"Hi!  How are you?  Today, I am working toward getting donations for an international organization called Save the Children.  Are you a parent? I'm really good.  I have three children in high school.  I always wanted more children and I think that is why I am so passionate about Save the Children.  Do you donate to any children's charities? Personally, I only donate to two causes.  I donate to a local Down Syndrome Organization and Save the Children.  I have found that many charities are making the organizers rich and the money doesn't always go toward causes I believe in.  Have you heard of Save the Children? Lol!  I have seen it several times as well, but I assure you, it is real.  Donations to Save the Children ensure children's right to health, education and safety.  I prefer helping people in my own community, however, I feel that Save the Children is so important to children in the USA and other countries.  Today, I am only looking for a small donation.  Would you ever consider donating to an international organization? To prove that Save the Children is real, I can provide their website if you would like to research it:   URL  Sometimes I doubt what I see on mTurk too!  I wanted to assure you the organization is real.  Did you see that half of refugees are children and 77 cents a day can provide shelter for an entire family? When I saw that, it made me feel terrible.  Just yesterday I spent twice that on a fountain drink at a gas station.  I drank half of it and threw the rest away.  Did you have an amount you were thinking of donating? Like I said, I am only looking for small donations today, so $1 would be fantastic!   The research team will collect all donations and send them to Save the Children I agree.  I always do mTurk hits as a way to save for a family vacation.

They promote children's rights and provide relief to support children in developing countries.  Many children around the world benefit from their work. I do donate to Save the Children and I agree with you that human trafficking is something we need to tackle.  It makes me sad that people including children are subjected to such horrors.  Why our world has to have such evil is beyond me. I agree and Save the Children provides proof on how they spend their money.  You can view that information on their website.  You can also view reports created by independent resources proving they allocate funds as they say. Wow, that makes me angry when organizations conduct themselves that way.  I understand the need for costs and needing to use some of the money for that.  I like that Save the children specifically states that they use x amount of every dollar.  The financial audits back up their claim.  So I can rest assured that the value of my dollar is going to the children as they promise. I plan to donate for sure.  I figure that half of my earnings would suffice.  It will help children and I will still benefit.  It seems like a proper thing to do. Looking at the Saving the Children foundation is appears they are doing extensive work in Africa.  What areas of the world do you think could benefit from this organization? I agree, I hurt for all children facing bad conditions but in the United States we face a lot too.  It would be nice if they also had a allocation schedule for regions of the world.

"Are you interested in bettering the rights of children in developing countries? There are many children starving all over the world, unable to attend their school classes, and dying from treatable diseases. I am collecting donations for a charity called Save the Children! We are a non governmental organization the helps support children in third world and developing countries. We are an international organization that supports children's rights, and are working to help provide these necessities. Would you like to know more?   Every day around the world 22,000 children die (according to UNICEF survey 2018) due to complications arising from poverty. Children as young as 4 are forced to work long hours in unsafe conditions, unable to go to school to better their situations. In addition to poverty, war torn countries such as Syria have subjected millions of children to a daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, more than 1,000 children were reported killed just in Syria. Do you have any questions about the organization so far? Save the Children participates in a number of child protection programs that are designed to work with governments to develop and implement protective policies for children. Inside Syria, we're on the ground, ensuring children are safe, cared for and learning. We're providing lifesaving services and supplies. We're tending to children's physical and psychological needs. And we're setting up safe places for children in crisis to learn and play, critical for child development. Despite extreme humanitarian challenges, we've helped 2.5 million people in Syria, including 1.7 million children.  I agree. Syria is statistically the most dangerous place to be a child - of all conflicted-affected countries in the world. Save the Children is doing whatever it takes to end this war on childhood - so Syria's children have a future. Today I have an opportunity for you to donate to Save the Children, at no out of pocket cost to yourself. Are you interested?   I appreciate your enthusiasm for the cause. I would like to let you know that a donation as small as 77 cents can help to house a refugee family for a day, and unlike other organizations that only donate 10% or less, we keep a low administrative cost so that 86% of all donations are used directly to help support these children in need. Your donation with be directly deducted from your task payment. Do you have any further questions I can answer for you today?

The dumpsters in cities are filled with food that could feed all the hungry in the world. That is awesome to hear about France I hope other countries follow that trend, I think if all the restaurants and grocery stores donated food that would of been thrown away they could fix the hunger issue overnight. They really should have different policies in place, we have more than enough hungry and homeless to eat all the excess. We certainly have way too much excess here in the USA I'm the same way, prices just keep going up and up but at least the sales make shopping possible. It can almost be a fun game to have to make a meal plan from only whats on sale.

So speaking of non-profits, would you be interested in donating some of your bonus from this HIT to Save the Children? Sure.  Save the Children gives children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. When crisis strikes, they are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. They do whatever it takes to save children, transforming their lives and the future we all share.

I do as well and wish many more people would.  I like that they and a lot of other charities are utilizing the technology to make donations a lot easier. Good for you!  Okay have you hear about any charities lately that have been doing extra due to the wars in which civilians are unfortunately in the wrong place with little help? Let me give you an example for instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Yeah a lot of people are unaware of exactly what is going on in this messed up world.  I wish the media would actually do more to help out.

"Hi. What brought you to this task? So you are on MTurk? like me? Well, we just need to discuss a social issue, one very near to my heart. Chidren's welfare. You know how you feel when you read about some abused child? Well, that's great, but you know the BIGGEST problem is kids with poor parents (or no parent around), not the ones that are mistreated. Do you know any children personally who show up for school half-dressed or hungry? That's good. Unfortunately I do, and for all the church groups and local government efforts, they continue to suffer. Well, government and most local social welfare groups go thru the PARENTS; they provide FAMILY support, and short of abuse there's no way they can force the money to be filtered down to the kids. That's why private welfare groups (many associated with schools, like I was implying) are an important way to address these kids' needs DIRECTLY. It's not like that: they provide school and after-school meals and social support (like school sorts and groups do.) ALL ABOVE BOAFRD and nothing shady. In fact, what brought me to this survey is pretty amazing (somewhat coincidental!) OKAY, so I am involved with a group called (duh) ""SAVE THE CHILDREN"" and you and I both have the opportunity RIGHT NOW to support this organization with some of what we make on this HIT! I mean it\'s not like we\'re beating our brains out on this survey. I think we should agree to donate half (or more) of our compensation to the group. Now you know they are international, not just the US, but I feel all kids deserve a chance.  OK thanks.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2). That's a great decision! Thanks very much for your support.

"Hi We are supposed to donate some money to Save The Children. How do you feel about that? Well it is easy and they will just take it out of our pay. Definitely; it is a worthy cause It is actually kind of hard. Many do not see the need or care. If that works for you, sure. I would be happy with that, because the need is so large. Our government is doing almost nothing to help children in need. Well yes. They can need much more than that, unfortunately. Fresh water and clothing is often not available in the third world. It is up to us to help, a situation that probably will continue regardless of who is in charge of our government. Alright. You could visit the Save The Children website. It is very interesting and informative.  URL  I can just tell you that helping is very satisfying. Doing something that matters. You could consider it a hobby like golf or a book club. It has been good to talk to you. I hope you will think about helping today.",0,FALSE
"Good evening!  How are you doing? I just got back from a trip to help Haitian Refugees with Save the Children, an amazing organization...and had a wonderful time. I try to go on an international mission trip every three years.  Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Have you ever been on a mission trip, or traveled to help children overseas? Understand...there are other ways to help.  I thought you might be interested in checking out the Save the Children website here:  URL  That is wonderful.  I know that not everyone has time to travel and do hands on work.  But, donations go a long way in helping out.  For example, just 77 cents a day can help shelter a refugee family.   Understand...My wife and I just had a child, so we understand tight budgets and paying off bills.  However, every little bit helps.  You can donate some of your task payment to Save the Children right now.  You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment ($2).  Is that something you think you could do this evening?

"Hello there, how are you doing today? Great! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. Have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children? Right on. So you understand how imperative it is that they stick around, as they help support and provide relief for children in developing countries. So, the researchers of this study are actually doing something very cool. You can help this charity directly by donating some or all of your earnings to Save the Children. Yeah, it's super cool! Even a small donation of 50 cents is great when lots of other people are donating too. Would you be interested in donating some of your task earnings? Awesome.

"hey :) Today I\'m representing an organization called ""Save the Children"", an international group that aims to provide aid to children from poverty and from disaster mostly. If you choose to donate money, it goes to providing food to impoverished children That may be true, but Save the Children has been recognized as reliable by charity rater. Additionally, this one has a high percentage of money raised going directly to helping support the cause. hundreds of thousands of children are dying every week due to lack of food Maybe this could be an exception for you then? I can understand your reasoning, but famine is a huge problem especially right now. More crop harvests are failing reducing the already low amount of food to near-nothing True, although higher populations in famine-ridden countries are necessary. There needs to be more people that are able to farm. Additionally, it's good karma. Every cent helps That's understandable. What would you consider a worthwhile charity? Food pantries? A lot of food worldwide comes from countries such as Zimbabwe or Haiti (countries that work with Save the Children). Right now there's famine, but by donating it will ultimately increase the worldwide food, and reduce the need for food pantries as a whole. Even though it's marketed at children, it's moreso helping the areas that have a high child poverty rate Makes sense, but countries like Italy or Japan are experiencing a population shift. Even in countries like USA and France, more doctors and scientists are retiring than graduating. So we need kids to supplement all of those areas In France tuition is not as expensive as in USA. There is a lack of population from 18-24, and there's even less of a population below 15. In Japan, the birthrate is low so keeping children is key as the population retires more. Children are the future work force, and help countries run economically and socially. By supporting this charity you would directly be supporting your future A lot of the time it isn't necesarrily overpopulation. In the case of Syria, there's a widespread civil war. Within the first quarter of 2018, over 1000 children were murdered by both sides. Save the Children has a mission to get as many children out of there as possible, because their heads are being used as trophies. It's sick and financial donation is the best way to help besides going there yourself That's understandable. So you're not interested in donation at all? To help keep children save from harm",0,FALSE

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Save the Children does work to help these children in situations that they and their parents are unable to control. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?

Organizations such as Save the Children are trying to reduce some of the evil and suffering in the world by spreading help and relief.

To be honest, not having a cell phone is hardly poverty. American children are hardly in the situation that many African children are Why not be charitable to all?  $2 is hardly a sum to argue about.  17 cents can feed  child overseas.  12 kids could be fed today with that money.

"Hi, how are you today? I'm good, I'm never ready when I should be , haha Well, how do you feel about charity's like Save the Children? Do you donate often? Would you ever consider donating? Sure, they go to many things well, revolving around children anyway. Some of their funding goes to the refugee children who are going hungry, without education, and medical help. They go to children who have been through natural disasters to help them and their families rebuild the communities like the most recent hurrican in Texas. They also fund programs for inner city kids to have a safe haven while continuing their education. Yes, I've donated reguarly, most of the time I wish I could do more but even the smallest amounts help.... even pennies add up if there's enough ::) Well, today the research team are giving all of us the oppurtunity to donate some of our bonus money if we are interested in doing so....   I'm going to donate $.25 of mine like I said it's not much but something is better then nothing at least that's what I've been told since I was a kid :) Well, they're a international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

"Hello! Have you ever donated to a charity before? I have too! I love dogs. What about Save the Children? Save the Children is a great organization. Would you be willing to donate some of your earnings from this task toward that charity? That's so generous! It's easy to donate when you feel attached to the situation, but helping someone you don't know takes a really special kind of person. I agree! Have you ever volunteered your time for a charity? We're all so busy or sometimes it's hard to get out to help so donating is a really good way to be able to help. Based on my understanding of Save the Children, it's an organization that is really important in this present time. In 2018 many children are affected by wars (for example Syria).  Anything you could donate would be amazing, from .01 to the full $2. Even a small donation helps multiple children. Do you think you could give a little more? That's great. I think about the amount of money I spend on buying cup of coffee these days, I could definitely go without one in order to help some kids! Maybe we can each encourage someone else in our lives to make a donation, and spread the impact. Do you feel like you're willing to donate that .50 cents? That's amazing.

"Hello, you are speaking with David. If you would please check out the following site  URL and let me know your thoughts I would greatly appreciate it. Indeed it is, helping children find education and a safe environment are very good causes. How do you feel about charities? I can understand that, Save the children's only focus is to help kids who cannot help themselves. Some of which are in war form countries or who are on the brink of starvation. Today you have the opportunity to use a portion of your task fund to go straight towards Save the Children. It is up to you how much you'd like to give. Between 0$ and 2$ but just keep in mind as little as .50 cents can go a long way in these countries. How much would you be willing to give of the 2$ towards this cause? That's fantastic! After the task is over you will get the opportunity to do so.  It varies, sometimes we have people who choose to not donate. However a lot of the time we generally see at least some of the money going to this great cause, even up to the maximum of 2% I agree, I also put in at least 2$ a day myself towards this great endeavor. Knowing that it goes to a good cause feels good. Thank you so much, every amount helps! We are almost done here at which point you will be able to do that. How else do you think we could further help those in need besides what you've seen so far? Wow that's fantastic! You are very altruistic, and for that we appreciate you a great deal. If everyone saw the world the same as you did, these problems would exist. I'd like to see the service branch out, helping women in these countries as well. The countries that these problems occur in women are often not treated the same as we are generally accustomed to. I know but I can only do what I can in this organization. I would again like to thank you for your willingness to donate 1$ to help this great cause and hope you have a fantastic rest of your day!",0,FALSE

"Hello!  Hope you are having a wonderful day.  Have you heard of the charity Save the Children? Would you ever consider donating any portion of your earnings from MTurk to a charity such as this? I think I would donate to a charity like this if given the chance.  I think it is important to help those less fortunate.   Yes.  Saving the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.  If people like us donate I wonder how much an impact it could make on the world around us? Yes.  I have heard and read about countless stories of children dying from hunger all over, so even to help one child is a major impact.  Sounds like you are willing to donate to this cause? Not personally, but I just like to talk to people about the greater good.  I know in America we are blessed and it is good to help those who can't help themselves.  I like you work this job to make money, but occasionally donate when I can.  Obviously, I can't do it every time, but a small donation every once in a while helps. That is true.  I sometimes struggle with the time issue since having a family, so donations like this help me feel like I am making an impact.  I think it would be helpful for this cause if we donated to this charity.

This is for Save the Children, an international organization that benefits children in impoverished areas who otherwise wouldn't receive basic services that many of our children take for granted. You would specify how much of your $2 payment you are willing to donate to this great cause, and the researchers will pass it onto Save the Children instead of paying it to you.

I fell 50 feet and broke my wrist, toe, thumb, sternium, ribs, heel. I was climbing a mountain and had to do a mountain rescue.  Sorry for the delay in responses. It's hard to type. About a year. I enjoy volunteering my time and services with my skills. I'm an avid rock climber and mountaineer and a few weeks ago I did a charity climb to raise money for the local childrens hospital.  Thanks. I'm happy not to be dead or paralyzed. What kind of shelters? Animal, children, homeless?  Oh nice. I've helped with the climbing out of homelessness programs up here in Seattle. The shelters take homeless and addicts and put them through a program to climb mt rainier. It's all through donations. A lot of people are down on their luck, but there's also a lot of mental issues and addicts. It's quite sad, so I applaud you for helping. One thing I found out is you can donate partial mturk funds to a childrens foundation, did you know that? Yeah, I try and donate a partial bit of my earnings. Even though I'm down on my luck I still have a roof over my head and food in the fridge. This organization helps with health, housing, and education for children. Would you like to help out too?

I am very blessed to be able to enjoy my weekend, there are many people in this world who are not so fortunate to enjoy theirs.  I use to be one of those people. I feel bad for children who have little control of their situation and can't even enjoy their childhood. Exactly! Have you heard of the Save the Children charity? Tehy provide Health resources, education, protection and emergency relief to children around the world. Yes, they are trying their best but there never seems to be enough. Children are still dieing of hunger and others are growing up in war zones constantly under attack.  I know that is how it feels but their is something we can do about it. We can donate to Save the Children. They are a professional orgization with international impact, it is a trustable fund that uses the money for its intended purposes. Even the smallest donation amount has an impact on an orginization like this one. For the same amount that gets spent in vending machienes at school/work, or the cost of a starbucks coffee, would really help Save the Children's charity.  Never discount the small donations, they add up over time. Larger donations make a bigger impact (of course!) but not many people are able to donate such a big chunk at a time. If we were all able to donate our entire income to the charity at least once then we could begin to really Save the Children. Do you think you would be able to do that?

Well, let me ask you this. What do you believe the value of charity is to you?  I would argue that the recipient is not relevant. You see, in my opinion, Charity in and of itself is a selfish act. Or perhaps, a better way to say it is that it is more of an exchange. We exchange our time, energy, money etc for a powerful thing. That thing is called purpose.  Perhaps, but does the definition matter to those who are in need?  Well, I have one in mind specifically. It's called Save The Children. They seem pretty fantastic. Theyve single handedly reduced the infant mortality rate by 62% in third world countries. Can I verify that? Of course not. But I believe it. And thats what matters to me. I believe that the little I have to give could help, and because of that it makes me feel delightful. I'm doing my best with what I've got. Are you? Of course! As you should. I believe your heart it good, I can tell just from talking to you anonymously. But I also believe that there is more of you to share with the world. The world needs it, and I believe you want to feel it.

We're planning to hit the beach, but it's a shame that there are so many kids in poverty who won't be able to enjoy the beach or birthday parties. Don't you agree? I agree. We live near the beach right now too, and it's great. My kids are so fortunate to be living a life so far removed from war zones like kids in Syria. And, to have their basic needs met to be able to enjoy their childhood. Have you heard of Save the Children? It's an awesome nonprofit that helps fight for children's rights all over the world.  URL has a lot more information.  Oh, I totally understand. I feel like most of those organizations take the money and run. Save the Children actually has 86% of the money that is donated directly helping the children. It's listed on Forbes list of top 50 charities.  They also have their annual financial report actually listed on their website which I think is pretty impressive for a charity organization. Would you consider donating part of your pay for this task to Save the Children? I understand. It's important to do research before giving money to organizations. This one just seems like they're doing a lot of great work helping children in the U.S. and abroad. And, it would be so easy to have your payment taken directly from your task payment. I haven't in the past, but after reading more about them I definitely plan to. Their credentials are outstanding. And, I like that so much of their proceeds actually go to help. I've seen some awful numbers from organizations like Goodwill who claim to be helping but all of their money actually goes to their CEO's. Oh, really? I haven't heard about Susan G Komen being so bad, I will have to look into that. I did a race of theirs about 10 years ago.  That's awful. That's why I'm pleasantly surprised to see that Save the Children has such a high percentage of donations being used. And, no. They don't only help in Syria. They support kids all over the world by helping them get healthcare, education, making sure their safe, etc. I'm going to donate part of my proceeds. I think you should too!",0,FALSE

I was just leading into that. To be honest I could never imaging if anything happened to my daughter. And there are some non governmental organizations out there that help children like my daughter who are in trouble in developing countries. Would you like to know more about this organization? This organization is called Save the Children. They provide relief and help support any child in need in developing countries. They go where they are needed. Personally I think this organization is needed especially being a new father I know how vulnerable children are now. And sometimes they just need help.  Absolutely! I can attest to that! Organizations like this primarily operate off of donations. Have ever contributed to non profit organizations? I know what you mean! sometimes it is hard to find the extra time or money to help those that need it.  Would you be willing to entertain the idea of donating some or all of the 2 dollar bonus received by completing this hit? I absolutely do. Even the smallest amount would go a long way in helping this organization. I was thinking of doing even .15 of my bonus to this organization. That way I still get a majority of my bonus and hopefully others will donate as well so those tiny amounts add up so something of value for Save the Children. That is understandable. My thought is its only .15 of my bonus and it would take more time to vet the organization then the donation is worth. Sometimes you have to go with that gut feeling and looking at my daughter sleeping right now I do not want any child to go without help that needs it.  That is understandable.

Not many people are aware of the organization! They have many ways that we can help continue their mission. Are you familiar with any of those programs as well? Yes, the feeding program is probably the most common and also one of the most successful.  However they do have other programs as well that helps keep them moving.  You can become a monthly donor, sponsor a child, shop the gift catalog from their website, or there's the Make a one-time gift program, which is what I'm here for! They can feed entire camps with several couple dollars! That's how they're funded! They get running water and electricity to children that need it.  Just a few bucks adds up when its coming from a couple of people, you know? I don't think so at all. It makes you a contributor to a wonderful cause, not a drop in a bucket! If a few bucks was the difference between getting child(ren) out of a hostile living environment and into one more stable, wouldn't that mean something to you? That definitely could be the case. It's not meaningless. It's a valued contribution. That's great to hear and you have the perfect opportunity right now.  You could give the $2 from chatting with me about this cause and donate again - by any one of those means that I mentioned above in any amount that you are satisfied with.

"Hi! How are you?  Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Yup. They promote children's rights and help support children in developing countries Yeah, some organizations probably spend a lot on that. In 2017, 86% of Save the Children's expenditures went to program services Yeah! It's ranked really highly among other nonprofit organizations. Their independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars they spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. They keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs. Yes! They've helped 157 million children in 120 countries. Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. When you focus on children in rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Through Save the Children's education, protection and emergency programs, they reached 638,000 kids in 2016 alone. That's definitely true. Save the Children targets America's most isolated and underserved children. 20% of children in the US grows up in poverty; of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural, which is why rural America is a focus for this organization. It doesn't mean that children in urban areas aren't important too, of course! That's so true. It's great to feel like we have the power to make a difference in kids' lives by donating to organizations like Save the Children! Would you like to donate to the charity now to help kids get the food, education, help, and support that they need to thrive? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

"Hello how's it going? Decent, bit of a slow start to the morning on Turk but it is the weekend so I guess that's expected I've been working this for almost two years now. The busier season is starting as the colleges in the US will be started/starting soon so that helps Yea it's definitely worth it to me. I do some at my work on days when its slow but mostly just in my off time instead of going on social media or something I come here Haha exactly! When college is in session we get more studies/surveys posted as a lot of the work on Turk is done for academic reasons. So in the next couple weeks we'll see an influx of students doing their psychology studies and such via the platform. It varies but generally a few hours on my workdays and maybe like 6 or 8 on my days off I'd say On the task page sort so you see the newest HITs, and grab whatever looks good to you as far as surveys. I'd recommend being wary of doing multiple HITs for any 1 requestor until you vet them yourself because rejections early on in a Turk account can make getting better hits tough (a lot of the better hits require 99% or higher approval rating) - and remember you'll get a lot faster at it as you keep going, it can feel a bit slow and tough at the beginning but it does get better Website searching can be good, it never hurts to try a HIT once - see how fast you can complete it and decide if it\'s worth doing more from there. One other cool thing about MTurk is that some studies allow you to donate money to a charitable cause directly from the task payment - This one we\'re doing now in fact allows us to donate towards a foundation called ""Save the Children"" At the end of the study they will ask if you'd like to donate from your payment to the foundation, they assist needy children all around the globe in dire situations. Would you be willing to donate any of your payment today to help save the kids? It will tell you in a short blurb above the box to donate (I've done this HIT before in the past) and the researchers ensure 100% of any amount you donate goes to the kids.

They have US and global programs. It depends on where the kids are that need help. They help with food, medical care, shelter, basic necessities. The address on the website is Fairfield, CT I don't really know the answer to that. If you are interested, they have a website. I need to end this now. Have a nice day! It's really up to you.

Sure, they are an international organization not connected to any government that promotes children's rights and provides relief and support to children in developing countries. Right now they are in 120 countries and have helped 33.3 million children directly. I am partial to children's charities because they help the ones who can't really help themselves. They provide better healthcare and education for children as well as providing emergency aid when natural disasters occur or war and other conflicts. Did you know in Jan and Feb alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in Syria due to violence in that country? Yes in fact the most recent rating of Save the Children by a non profit charity watchdog gave it an ""A"". I think that is pretty clear. I agree. I think more people need to get on board to help the children. If we all do a little by sacrificing that 1 coffee a week or by eating out one time less per week, we could all make more of a difference, right? That is true for sure. I'm going to give some of my earnings today to STC, would you be willing to give some also if only $.25? Sure, it is  URL but just know that if you donate through here the research team collects the donations and sends it all to STC so it is above board. Yes definitely.

Not yet but I am traveling to Uganda with STC in March! Have you ever wanted to do something like that? We will be setting up a pseudo- children's hospital. More like a nurses station to help sick kiddos in remote villages. They definitely can! And you can help, too! By supporting STC! Would you like to learn how? There is no such thing as a small donation. If you'd be willing, you could donate some or all of your incoming payment for this task to STC! It'd be nothing more than a bag of chips at the store.

It most certainly is - every bit is appreciated! The kids will benefit greatly from this as the researchers have been doing hundreds of HITs so it really does add up when everyone donates a small amount. I'm going to donate $.30 - today has been a good day for HITs so it won't kill me heh. And just think how many other pairs of people are making the same decision!

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. it would be a portion of the task payment.  you can choose any amount from $0 to all ($2). this information i'm not privy to for privacy reasons, but for example, 77 cents a day can shelter a refugee family.  any amount makes an impact. that's great!  have you contributed to any like organisations in the past? that's very good to hear.  the sum of parts are greater then the whole and it really pools everyone together to make a big impact to those in need. thank you kindly.  that is most appreciated.",1,TRUE
"Hello! How are you doing today? I'm doing alright. Just had a baby recently, so trying to get back to my normal routine. Do you have any children? I can't imagine doing it alone. This was number four for me, feels like anything above one is pure chaos.  You must be really busy do it on your own.  Do you have a moment to talk about a charity I am really passionate about? It is called Save the Children. Have you heard of it before? Well it is a charity that supports kids in developing countries. It is not related to government. They do anything from education to safety to nutrition.  Something  a lot of people in first world countries don't have to worry about. A lot of the stories are so heartbreaking.  Have you ever donated to a charity like this? That is a great charity! And I like the fun aspect of the red noses to raise awareness.   This charity is similar to that one in that it focused on those who are in great need.  Any money you would donate to this charity would address similar issues and go to a great cause. Do you have any questions about Save the Childen? I completely understand. I'm sure that you have a lot on your plate being a single parent. And raising kids is so expensive.  Even small amounts can go a long way.  Would you even being about to spare some change? If you did have money, would you donate to a charity like this one? That is good to hear. Hopefully when you think about receiving your bonus today, you can think about the good that you could do with a small amount. What you might spend on a candy bar or can of pop could do a lot to help a kid in need. I hope you reconsider. Well I hope you have a great weekend. You have a lot to be thankful for. Nice talking to you.",0,FALSE

I donate when I am able to, I need to secure donations from others before I am able to make that decision myself assuming I make 2 dollars, I would like to donate at least 1 dollar In order for me to donate I would need to know how much you would like to donate. To be clear, this dollar would come out of your task payment. Would you still choose to make that donation knowing this? Yes, I would be happy to do so. If you were given the choice, what would you like this to go towards? This is the organization yes, but what I meant is if there was anything specific you would like that donation to help with? I'd like for it to go towards refugee housing. My goal is for the donation to help as many people as possible If you were willing to donate $1.50, I'd donate as much. Then I'd be willing to support both. That way it's more of a substantial donation for both. I would be willing to commit to us both donating $1.50",1.5,TRUE
"Have you ever heard of save the children?  It's a great organization and has an international impact. Children in other countries are suffering with no help in sight. I like to donate a small amount of money every year. I also help children as well because my son was born and had to placed in the NICU for sugar problems. Every year I crochet 200 hats for the hospital NICU babies. Have you ever thought about donating to Save the Children?  Me too! However, today you could donate 0-2 bucks of your payment from this task to help those children. Just think you it's only 1-2 bucks and you will be helping a poor innocent child in a war torn country. Could you imagine, running around barefoot, in rubble, being a three year old, crying, hungry, and looking for help help. You hear gunshots all around you and the sound of bombs exploding in the distance.  I would never judge you for only donating .25 cents! That's .25 more cents than they had before. Just think that could be your child... Wouldn't you want any funding you could receive so your child could benefit!  Thank you the research team will collect all donations and send them to save the children. God bless us with people like you so others won't have to suffer alone. Your generosity is greatly appreciated!!  If you get time, go to Save the Children's website and check out more information. Maybe someone you know would like to make a donation or match your donation to help children in other countries affected by war and poverty. Remember it's not about how much you donate but that fact that you donated... That alone will help others... How many children do you have? I have two and when I watch the news my heart hurts so badly. Save The Children is also not government affiliated so your donation will be spend where its needed..

"Hello. How are you today? I am fantastic. Thank you for asking.  I am. Actually a teacher in the states. What about you what do you do for a living? Oh yea? Does that make a great impact on the peoples lives ? Always good to make somone excited. Can even vastly improve on their lives. Ever felt bad for someone who couldn't afford the car you were trying to sell, but knew they really needed one? I currently teach young kids. Mostly in urban communities who are low income and in need of good caring teachers. Keeping them off the streets and such. Most usually need some sort of help. What kind of area do you work in? But of course they love me. Kids in different areas are still kids lol. Urban and rural both have their challenges. Have you ever helped kids or is their little time for that? Oh so you know all about helping already. We need people who adopt and take care of those who were abandoned. Ever donated to one of those save the kids charities? I'm the same way. However, every bit helps especially when I am so busy mentoring the kids after school. Sometimes, I just throw a dollar or 2 out to help a kid get some food or a snack. Heck just to reward them for not hanging around the rough streets with the drugs.  Hypothetical... if you could give a kid a dollar or 2 right now for some food to eat.. even for one meal.. would you? Of course and I alway do lol. I can give the chance to do so right now if you would like? I sure would.  Sounds about right. Mind if it is deducted from your task payment? Alright then a donation of 1$ will be deducted from your task payment. I am sure you have just made a child day.. once again.",0,FALSE

We rarely had it in NC and if it did snow, everything closed. Could I ask for your help with something? I am trying to get donations for Save the Children from people who complete this task.  You can donate any amount, from $0-$2.00, but anything would help.  Is that something you would consider? Sure, Save the Children is an organization that helps ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety around the world.  Yes, they also help alleviate child poverty in the US, but there is a particular lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. No, it is a non-governmental organization that has impeccable credentials.  Wow, that is great! I really appreciate it.  If more people would be willing to donate to organizations like this, they could help so many other children.  How much would you like to donate?

My heart just goes out to them. Would you be willing to donate a portion of your bonus to these children? Save the Children. The research team can organize for them to receive it. I am also going to donate half of my bonus to them. Things add up and can make a difference in someone's life. Will you help us? Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.  Actually I haven't. I was just looking for a way to make a contribution and found them. The researchers for this study will handle the monetary contribution. These days you really have to be careful of sending money to anyone. I figured that since this is a bonus, we wouldn't even have to give any credit card information, it's perfect. How much do you like to donate to the charity? I'm giving a dollar!  All proceeds donated will be given to the charity. We really have to help each other in this world. Thank you so much for our talk today and your donation. Hopefully other opportunities will allow us to be more effective in changing the world around us!

"Hi. My name is MJ. Nice to meet you.  Well, I'm here to talk about Save the Children. It's a charity. It's an international, nongovernmental agency that promotes children's rights in developing countries. No. It helps with education and food, especially for kids in war-torn countries. Yes. It has great credentials. That's something that's important to me, especially as I have limited amounts to donate. I agree with you! It doesn't spend a lot on administrative costs. I'm very particular about that, too. I'm going to have to look that up. Give me a sec. 86% goes to program services. I'm going to donate $1 of my earnings on this HIT. It's less than the cost of a cup of coffee these days. Syria is a big one. There are kids that are under the daily threat of violence. Mainly developing countries in war zones. Think about donating a little bit of your HIT.  50 cents? I assure you it is. I know it isn't much. I can't afford to give a whole lot either, but the cause matters to me.",0,FALSE
"Hey!  I'm excited to see how this works.  How are you doing? Great!  Have you ever heard of Save the Children - an international organization that helps kids in poor countries? I've just started learning about it, but I think it's incredible to be able to help kids who need it.  What country are you from?  What are your feelings about this topic? I totally get it.  It's non-government at least.  Last year they helped kids in Bangladesh who were refugees.  I think they see where there is a need and step in - so larger groups of children. Shelter, food, hygiene, water, even training for how to take care of themselves.  It's the type of thing where you could give a little (or a lot) at one time, or sponsor a child, or do a one time give that supplies them with food or water or hygiene for a certain amount of time.  Lots of options... Fourteen percent is fundraising and management - so 86% goes to the kids.  That's pretty good! Our family sponsors a child, and it gives us a good sense of ""giving back"".  It\'s why I asked where you are from.  I feel like in America we have so much!!!  It feels like we are helping more than ourselves and the people around us when we give internationally. That's so great!  Churches are the best place to offer help - it Sorry I hit the return button instead of the ' button last time...  We attend church too, and it's another reason why we want to give - I mean it reminds us of how much we've been given.  Do you have any desire to give to this Save the Children organization? It could even just be the donation of this HIT... Sounds good.  Here's the link if you want more info later:  URL   I hope you find the perfect job soon!  I know being in your position can be stressful.  Glad you've got a community in your church that can hopefully give you encouragement too!  Maybe they have small groups you could join?  That helps at our church... Hang in there!  Bye!",0,FALSE
"Hello! Oh, alright. I made the mistake of reading the news today, which always kind of bums me out.  Well, it seems like it's all Trump all the time, but I started reading an article about children in developing countries and rates of illiteracy and starvation. It struck me how those things haven't really changed much for the 40 years I've been around.  I feel like Trump won't help... we'll be lucky if he doesn't make it worse. Donating to a charity is probably the best way we can help. I used to think that it wasn't helpful unless I had a lot of money at my disposal, but now, I ferl sorry, I bumped the send button before I was done typing. I really think any amount would help. Now that I have children, I imagine horrific things that could have happened to them if they weren't so lucky. Would you consider donating all of your incoming payment for this task to the Save the Children charity? The researchers can collect the funds and donate it directly, so it's no hassle.  Would you consider making it an even $2.00? That's cheaper than a cup of coffee.  A dollar is better than no dollars! That's very nice of you.  Me too!  I bet they will.  It's nice to be able to be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. I appreciate that the charity is separate from the government. I think I'm going to throw in another dollar.

Actually, there a huge number of countries that are helped by Save the Children. It's an international organization. Some of the countries include the U.S., Uganda, Kenya, Peru, and Cambodia.  Did you know that, even one year after the destruction caused by hurricane Harvey, Save the Children is still present in Texas helping children to fully recover? It's truly a blessing what they do. Money also goes to provide shelter.  Just 77 cents a day can provide shelter for a refugee family. Do you think Save the Children is a cause that you would consider donating to? In 2017, 155 million children were helped. There's always more to do though. How would you feel about helping Save the Children by donating some or all of your payment from this task? Even 10 cents is helpful. Thank you! That's great that you donate to animal charities. I support PAWS Chicago too.  No doubt! I just heard about a country does not kill rescue animals in shelters.

Understandable, of course, although we do get good pay out of this task that we can donate. Have you heard of Save the Children? It's a great charity I've considered donating some of my payment too, if you want to do the same. What do you mean, like how does the charity help children? They provide relief for kids and they help underprivileged kids with things they need, such as water, first aid, etc.  I believe so, it extends to other countries as well.",0.2,TRUE
"Hello I'm up early this morning, working for my favorite charity. It's called Save the Children. Are you familiar with their work? They are amazing! They have been around for decades. They work for children's rights to health, education, and safety, especially in poor and developing countries. Children can be terribly exploited for labor and worse. They actually work in 120 countries! They are currently helping up to 157 million chidlren! Well for instance, they tackle malnutrition. That's a huge focus of their work. It is stunning how many children have nothing to eat and it actually takes just pennies a day to feed them.  There is actually no minimum.The great thing is, you can choose to donate up to $2 right now if you would like to do so.  The research team tallies what participants would like to contribute from their task today. You can indicate you would like to donate your payment for this conversation, and the research team handles it from there.  Yes, they actually do. For example, there are more than 14 million kids in the US growing up in poverty. It's actually 1 in 4 kids in rural America. They run education, protection, and emergency programs to help those kids right here at home.  Agree! There are kids in desperate need everywhere. So would you like to commit to donate your payment for just this one task today, up to $2 if there is a bonus?  You can communicate with the research team, perhaps try to specify!  Thanks so much!!",0,FALSE
"Do you ever donate to charities? Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Save the Children is a charity that helps ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Save the Children helps children around the world especially in developing countries. Save the Children is a completely transparent charity that puts most of donations directly toward helping children. The lack of help to children around the world has been very tramatic.  In the first two months of 2018, 1,000 children in Syria were reported killed or injured.  Your donation can help address these problems. Save the Children is a professional and longstanding organization that has a record of helping children around the world. The money that you spend on stuff like a bag of candy can be used to help feed and protect children.  Would you like to donate today? You can donate directly from your bonus.  You can also go to their website. Your donation is very appreciated and you can feel confident that it will help tremendously.  Thank you very much and have a wonderful day.",1,TRUE
"Hello!  I hope you are doing well.  This is an interesting task - I'm glad to see that part of the payment for this task is donated to such a good cause.  What do you think? I don't know much about the specific charity, but I'm a mom, and I think it's really important to help kids around the world.  From what I've heard, Save the Children is a great organization that really makes a different.  I've read they've been doing a lot of work in Syria.  The info that I'm seeing on my end is that we can choose to donate part of what we earn in this task to Save the Children.  It's a large philanthropic organization that works on ensuring children's rights to health, education, and safety.  They have apparently done work recently to help children in Syria impacted by the civil war.   I don't see any exact date.  However, they have done work to improve access to education, medicine, and food in Darfur and appear to have been working when that area was also impacted by civil war.   I am debating between 50% and all of the bonus.  So between 1 and 2 dollars.  I think even $1 can make a difference in their efforts.  What about you? I think that seems fair.  From the description, they seem to have a pretty low overhead so even $1 will go directly toward the charitable efforts.  They've also apparently been involved in Jimmy Carter's organization that seeks to give kids and families clean water by getting rid of the guinea worm.  The water filters they use only cost $.90 Sounds like a good plan. So that $1 will be deducted from the payment.  My instructions say the research team will send all the donations directly. Yes - I think that's nice.  They are making it an easy task for us! Seems like we are in agreement.  It was nice working with you. You too.  It's nice to have a long weekend - enjoy it!",1,TRUE

"Good morning! I hope that you are having a great day so far! Indeed I am :) would it be alright with you if I spoke to you a little bit about a wonderful charity called Save The Children? Thats great! Save The Children is a charity program that helps millions of children across the world. We provide numerous support groups and programs to help children everywhere. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. We provide protection to children and emotional support to them. That is amazing :) I have several friends and family that work together in my area to provide support for children and women against domestic violence. And to be able to speak to someone about the Save The Children Foundation is an honor. Across the US one in five children grows up in poverty. We have been around since 1932, providing support to the most isolated and under-served children in Rural America. The best program we offer in my opinion is Education and our programs to help children grieve and obtain the emotional support they need in order to grow. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I am more than happy to provide information about our cause. 86% of our funding goes to  Program Services, 9% goes into fundraising meaning we get the word out about the charity and set up events. And just 5% goes to management and general things. Here is a link that breaks down all our costs and the donations we receive.  URL s/about-us/financial-information PERSON_1: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: Our 86% was based off our 2017 annual report, I am sure there could be even more of a percentage as of late. Around 34% of donations go to health and nutrition, and my personal favorite is 21% into education benefits. I believe if we are able to give people a proper education they can learn so much and see that anything is possible in our world. That the world is not always cruel and that you can pull yourself from the ground up to the sky if you really want to.  I would like to apologize for my mistype in the previous message. It seems as if my wording went over and it caused some issues for the system. I completely agree with you as well. If we do not help our children then there will be no future. Every childs life matters, and where we are not forced to help those that need it, a lot of people still find the compassion to see that even a little amount of money can go a long way in helping those around us less fortunate. So based off our discussion would you be interested in donating to the charity now? Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment. Thats great! I would much rather give someone facts and accurate/detailed information about a cause or charity before asking for anything from said person. So that depending on what you like and what you hear you can make the decision yourself on what you feel would be a good donation. For I cannot decide how much you donate to the cause, but rather what I myself can donate. Do you have a figure in mind? Thank you so much! Your donation means the world, and is very generous of you.",1,TRUE

Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for contributing to them. I didn't realize that they help children here in the United States too.

"Hello! I need you to make a donation for us to work this out. We have to make sure we get a bonus by donating the $2. It's for Save the Children, and actually my family and I have experience with them. They're one of the more reputable charities luckily. But for this to work, I really need you to donate both dollars. My family has been involved with charities due to our business. We make regular donations and Save the Children actually has done the most with what we've given them. We own furniture stores on the west coast. We just love that they're so transparent with their spending and they give us concrete examples of why our past donations have helped them. Well, the examples they provided were specifically showing us what parts of their charity the money was going towards, and what those parts did. Essentially a lot of it was relief for the poor, in the form of shelter, clothing and food. I can't give you too many details, but trust me, donating the entire 2 would GREATLY benefit you. Not to mention the satisfaction of helping a charity that actually does good work. That's fantastic, so do I. Small amounts actually do go far. A couple bucks and it's a few meals for someone. It's mind blowing. Thanks! Then definitely donate the full two. You'll be really happy you did, trust me. Awesome, you'll be happy you did :) Thank you too, have a good night!",2,TRUE

"Hello there, how are you doing today? Very good. I've been hearing about this charity called Save the Children, and I'm consistently amazed at what wonderful work they do. Save the children is a Non-governmental organization, meaning it's independent. It promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Developing countries are places where the government isn't as strong, and many people live in poverty, so lots of things go unchecked that would be taken care of in more developed countries. It's important to have an independent organization look out for kids in those countries. Children are routinely treated in ways that are very bad in developing countries. We give them medical checkups. Many children in those countries have no routine access to healthcare, so they suffer from diseases like vitamin deficiency. We also help shine the light on abuse to help get them out of abusive situations. Yes. Recently Save the Children helped rescue a child who was dying from hunger in one such country. They also helped relocate many children who were orphaned by Syrian Civil War. Many tragic things happen but Save the Children helps children when no one else seems to care or be capable. Yes, you can. I donated as much as I possibly could and Save the Children told me that I helped save the lives of several children by giving them food and medical care. It really warmed my heart! I'd donate everything I had to them if I could. Yes, their website is  URL  Read through it and be sure to donate the maximum amount! The more kids saved the better! Your welcome! Also I think you'll like to hear that Save the Children was named as one of the ten most accountable charities in a recent study. They don't waste much on overhead. The head of the charity drives a 15 year old car! Yes, it's pretty legit. I'd say it's one of the most legit charities out there. They regularly make sure that the whole organization is audited. You can see where all the money goes in their reports. A lot of time and effort is spent in the third world countries and so every dollar you spend goes a long way. Yes, you can donate the maximum amount immediately. Okay, when you get it all together you can donate your task payment between $0 and $2.",0,FALSE

Isnt it heartbreaking to see how children in developing countries suffer compared to those here in the U.S. At least their is a charitable organization that advocates for these children. Unfortunately, not enough people donate this cause.  Yes, there is I plan on donating to this cause. It is true that every cent helps, even if it is just pennies.

From what I'm reading, it sounds like a great cause It seems to be international, and supports children in developing countries.  It's apparently very influential in war zones like Syria Absolutely.  It says on their site that in the first two months of this year alone, 1000 children were killed or injured there I can't imagine what that's like for the parents.  As a mom myself, I'm thinking about donating my earnings from this task to them From what I can tell, we can donate anywhere from 0 to $2 (the full payment).  Then through the official Save the Children website, I'm sure there's no max (and there'd be a tax deduction) How often do you donate to things like this?   I usually give to animal charities like the local no-kill shelter, but it's always interesting to learn about new places to make an impact.

Save the Children is just like St Jude's as well as they go all over the world to help a lot of children in need.  Yes they do. Save the Children gives a lot of medical assistance to children all over the world. They are responisble for giving many poor children vaccines. A lot of children around the world often don't have the vaccines that richer countries have to fight off preventable diseases. Yes they do.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

It doesn't break the bank for me and it makes me feel great each week that I worked hard to help someone, somewhere in the world.  It may be a small amount, but it makes a big difference, especially if more people are doing it.  All of what you give is what will be used. And if you don't trust that method, there is even a section on a site where you can sponsor a child directly that needs the funds immediately. It could be for books, medicine, food or even clothing for school. I've done if before in the past and helped a girl get school supplies for her first day of school.   You should try it out.

It's actually been around over 100 years and it makes use of donations to support various causes for children around the world. Education, emergency funds and disaster relief are 3 big causes they support. Addtionally, it looks like a pretty effecient organization with 87% off all donations going directly to support children.  Oddly enough, I never heard about it either but I was introduced to it here. I know some HITS make up factitious organizations, but this is actually a real charity, and seems pretty good. Awesome!

MANY HAVE LOVED IT ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE CHALLENGING, THE INSTRUCTORS ARE PAID VERY LITTLE BUT GIVEN FREE ROOM/BOARD.  HOWEVER AFTER ONE YEAR OF WORK THEY CAN APPLY THRU A SPECIAL PROGRAM TO BE CITIZENS OF THE HOST COUNTRY. THEY CAN BECOME A DUAL CITIZEN AFTER 1 YEAR IN THE PROGRAM. IN SOME CASES OUR INSTRUCTORS HAVE FOUND FULL TIME JOBS WITHIN THE HOST COUNTRY AFTER THEIR TENURE. MANY OF OUR CHILDREN PUT ON GLASSES FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER VISITED AN EYE DOCTOR.  JUST A 2 DOLLAR DONATION CAN GET ONE OF OUR SPONSOR CHILDREN ACCESS TO A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL SCREENING.

Are you familiar with the organization, perhaps from television or a class collection when you were in school?

I was always sad of the presentation of the poorly dressed child holding empty plate in the ads.  Are you aware of the other things the organization does for kids?  Yes! Besides the usual schooling and basic healthcare many of us are familiar with, Save the Children also assists communities during natural disasters such as earthquakes, they try to help communities with economic opportunities, and they event get involved with child intervention in area of war such as Syria or other parts of the world that are experiences in influx of refugees.  That's fantastic!  It is truly my belief that any gift is a good gift and not knowing your history or situation, I would not ask of you what you could not comfortably provide.

"Hello is someone there? Awesome, I am a part of the Save The Children fund and I have been connected to you because you marked that you wanted to help those in need around the world Correct, With a primary focus on those in troubled nations (such as war zones or poorly developed nations). If you would like to help, a donation from you could help save the thousands of children that deal with violence and hunger as a daily part of their lives. Of course, one of our focus points is to provide health care, education, and safety to these children to help give them a way out of their troubled lives. And your small donation can go a long way, something as small as the price of a candy bar can be the difference in these kids lives. In 2017 86% of all fund raise went directly to the children in need, and of the 86%, 34% was directly put into providing food and nutrition. Education, Emergency Relief, HIV/Aids treatment, and helping the children stay in a safe environment. I know its easy to ignore these children because they are half way around the world, but they need your help. Nearly 5.6 million children die each year due to preventable and treatable causes. Malnutrition contributes to the deaths of children and a lifetime of poor health. All it takes is an easy donation from you to help these children Much of the focus right now goes to war torn countries like Syria, but your donation would also go to help those who were hurt by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Maria in the Gulf of Mexico  So, How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Thats okay, a donation as little as 77 cents can house a refugee family for a day. Awesome, The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.",0,FALSE
"Hello. How are you today? Glad to hear it. Are you someone who has ever donated to a charity or offered your time for a charitable cause? I'm glad to hear that. Charity is very important. Can I ask what kind of organizations you have donated to? Those are very good causes. Have you ever heard of the organization Save the Children? Save the Children Promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries. They work in the US and internationally.  It is. More impressively, 86% of all expenditures go to program services so donations are used for the cause rather than allocated to profits.  I can understand that. But given that it is an international organization, there is overhead that must be paid for such as travel. This organization is especially helpful in countries where there is a lack of support for children in war zones such as Syria.  I understand. But many organization are too scared to go into countries like Syria where children are facing extreme violence. In the first 2 months alone, 1,000 children were killed or injured there. Save the Children does help in this country and others like it.  I can see your concern, but please know that this is a very worthy cause. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2). Thank you so much for your generosity. It will be put to very good use.

I will indeed. I'll be donating so that the children get the maximum benefit.  It's pretty amazing. According to the website, they help 157 million children in 120 countries.

"Good afternoon, how is everything going? I am doing relatively well and fine.  Well, I believe that overall I am good person with a great drive to do as much for people in general.  Many have said that I am a giving and kind person. Well, I basically help individuals who are closest to me by helping the elderly with very tasks locally.  I also have a tendency to help children around my neighbor by mentoring some.  I also help with my local congregation by a Godly person as well. Well, thank I appreciate your kindness.

Your donation will help to the overall betterment, improved health, education, and safety of many of these children who come from a developing country. Well, let me say this.  The children in these countries would like to have additional money provided because still in our modern day, it is still not enough to help.

"Hello! Have you ever heard of Save the Children? It is an organization that helps with children's rights to health, education, and safety.  I think so too! The organization is currently looking for donations. How much would you be willing to donate to their organization? According to their website, 5% of the donation goes to management and general, 9% is fundraising, and the remaining goes to the programs. You can donate directly from your bonus of $2- Can I get a commitment from you for any of the $2 to help the children?  They are advocates for our lower income students and children who have been struck by emergencies. They do a lot with education and all around mental health. You should take a look at their website  URL  There is a lot of beneficial information and ways to help get involved further. Based on the other information provided, it does seem that they are consistently there to provide the services for the children therefore I am lead to believe they must have some sort of follow up. The lack of support for the poverty stricken children in the US and in other countries is sad. Programs like this one need our support and voices like yours to make improvements to keep the organizations growing. Your $2 or any donation you decide to make will help the children now and hopefully keep the program growing to learn and do more. I'm so glad you found the information you were looking for. We spend so much money of small things like candy, coffee, and snacks. Those small purchases can be saved to help others.  With the information you have found, can we get you to make a donation? Super easy to donate and as you have found, it is a great organization. I didn't see that. I'm glad they are able to provide any help. I can't image that it is easy getting to other countries to provide aide. The areas they seem to go to are pretty dangerous.  It does. I bet they will eventually be able to raise those numbers as they expand. It will be interesting to watch their growth and how they impact the world. I hope that through our conversations and your research that you have made the decision to make a donation. Wonderful! Thank you so much for helping to make a difference. ",2,TRUE

I am here to let you know about this amazing international foundation called Save the Children that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support them in developing countries.  These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need. All I ask is that you donate a portion of your task payment to this charity to help the children. You are free to look up any information you like at  URL  100% of your donation will go directly to Save the Children. Just think of it this way, instead of getting your morning coffee, or that bag of chips at lunch, you could donate $2 today and help ensure that 3 children get the care they need and food in their stomachs. The research team will collect all donations and send it all directly to Save the children. So it will go to pay for the flights to get the team over there, medicine, food, everything needed to help these children Like I said earlier, 100% of your donation goes directly to helping these children. Look, already in 2018 alone, 1,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. They need your help. They need your donation more than you do honestly. What is $2 to you when that money can literally save lives over there? You can go to the website I provided you earlier to know in your heart that this is not a scam. Can I count on you to help these children? Are you willing to trust me enough to donate your task payment to help these children?  I went to the website and looked up the actual numbers. 86.5% of donations goes directly to the villages and the rest goes to fund the outreach, website, and publicity. it is a non-profit organization. You don't have to donate the entire amount of your task payment. you can choose any amount from nothing to the $2. I am just hoping you would be gracious to help these children enough to give the $2 and give them a fighting chance.

Nice.  What kinds of charities do you usually give to, if you don't mind me asking? I do as well here in Chicago.

One that I like is called Save the Children.  It's an organization that helps children in very difficult circumstances, both here in the US and around the world.  Have you heard of them before? Yes. It's  URL   There you will see the various projects they are working on.  For exaxmple, the work they are doing in Syria right now is incredibly important as there are unfortunately thousands upon thousands of orphans due to the war. Yes. I agree. That's also a very important endeavor.  There are just so many difficult situations out there for children.  But it's good to know at lease one organization tries to help the most in need.  Did you know that they accept donations from mturk?  So we could donate directly to them from our funds for this HIT.  Even small amounts go a long way when so many people donate. Ok.

You wouldn't even notice it's absece And how much money do you spend on luxuries like coffee, soda, fast food, etc? You really think that money couldn't be better used in Syria? That's short-sighted.

"Hello, have you heard of Save The Children? Save The Children helps kids from around the world by taking contributions from generous patrons. Kids from countries that have been stricken by poverty, violence, and other blights. Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now. Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter. It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK. I do not work for them, I work on behalf of them. That is why I'm talking to you today. These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you. A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want. Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars. For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment. Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers. We do it for them, not for ourselves. And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do. That is very kind! After this chat is complete, you may choose how ever much you wish to give on the next page. Would you like to know about a potential child this money would be helping? Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher. It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old. But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day. As you can see, $1 will change their world. One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about. Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people. This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country. Yes. You can slo sign up & stay connected on our website with your email and phone number. You can also volunteer if you're in the area of any of these children at our program centers. Thank you for donation, there will never be enough people like you in the world! ",1,TRUE
"Hello, how are you? I'm good, thanks for asking!  I wanted to tell you about this charity that I am interested in.  Would that be ok? Ok, great.  It's called Save the Children.  It is a non-profit organization that helps out children in need.  Currently they are helping Rohingya Refugees, those affected by Hurricane Harvey, and other areas impacted by disasters.  They do amazing work. Yeah, it is really sad.  I recently learned that nearly 5.6 million children die each year due to preventable and treatable causes.  So this charity can use all of the help it can get. This charity does a lot of work in the United States.  When you donate, you can specifically request that your money go to support programs or children in the U.S.  Since you like helping kids in the U.S., would you be willing to donate some of your incoming payment for this task to this wonderful charity?  Even a tiny amount would help. Awesome!  How much would you donate?  You can choose from $0.01 to $2.00. That's really nice.  We'll make sure it goes to help kids in the U.S.  Thank you so much. You're welcome.   I understand, it's really kind of you to donate anything at all.  Every little bit will help these poor kids.   I agree.

"Hi, how are you today? I am great! Thanks for asking. I am here today as a fundraiser for Save The Children, which is an organization dedicated to ensuring all children receive health, education, safety, etc.  I definitely do! I feel like I am helping to make a difference to a cause that ensures something as important as clean drinking water, and providing nutritious food to starving children. I am relatively new to this organization but have worked in fundraising for the last 3 years.  I, personally, have raised tens of thousands over the years. I took an active interest in Save the Children mainly because of the Syrian conflict and how millions of Syrian children grow up facing the threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured. Donations to Save the Children go directly to help in situations like these.  Save the Children works to alleviate child poverty in the U.S. to help children in poverty get the nutrition and education they need right now. Thanks to the generosity of donors, we help the nation's most vulnerable children become ready for kindergarten _ and excel by third grade _ so they can succeed in school and in life. Plus our teams are there before, during and after emergencies _ preparing children, protecting them and helping them cope in the aftermath. Absolutely! Thanks so much for your interest in this program. It is truly helping our most vulnerable. How much do you think you would like to donate? I can send you information on our different levels of sponsorship.  That's okay if you are unable to at the moment. I just would like to ensure that I send you the appropriate tier of sponsorship information. How much do you anticipate donating in the future. Just your best guess is fine. Well, thank you so much for your time! I will get some literature sent out to you about Save the Children and you can review it at your convenience. Thank you!",0,FALSE

The organization is not-for-profit. In fact, you can sponsor an individual child from countries all around the world who does not have the sustenance to survive Thank you for asking! Save the Children is a very interesting organization because you can provide specific needs to go the childre n including animals (goats, chicks, cows), education tuition, health essentials (vitamins, vaccinations, etc.), clean water faucets, and even purchase livestock for a whole village! However, your individual donation would be combined with another to purchase one of these necesities for the child   That's incredible! God bless them! I am not personally associated with Save the Children, I just wanted to promote their organization because I think it is very noble and a fantastic cause. You hit it right on the head. I have come to realize that most people would do anything to have the ""problems"" that we have in our daily lives. Not saying that they\'re aren\'t real problems in our society, but like you said, they are miniscule compared to what could be. With that being said, would you consider donating a portion of your task donation to Save the Children? You can donate any amount of your payment ($0-$2), any bit helps Absolutely!

I can tell you, however, that Save the Children is, in a way, more immediate in helping people (as opposed to fighting disease like St Jude's) and delivers services similar to the Red Cross, but directed toward children. So, please: think of the children! Their assistance is directed toward children in developing countries, where, unlike most of the US, children are totally deprived of opportunity and basic services.

"Hello, how are you doing today?  That is good to hear, barbecue chicken is always good too! I am doing well, just trying to talk to see if you would like to donate to Save the Children. It is an international organization that helps children in developing countries.  Not yet, it is something I am interested in doing though. Education is something that is really important to me and that is something that they help with. I think every child should have access to edcuation, especially in developing countries so that they can help improve their living situations.  I went through the public education system, it was one of the better school districts at the time. What about you? Is a lack of education something you faced? So you were able to have a good education experience as well. Isn't that something you would like to help other children receive? Anything from $0.01 to $2.00 or any amount you choose, it can go to helping them get an education.  Think about how often you buy a pack of gum or a candy bar, something you don't really need but it is because you want it. You can just skip that next impulse purchase to help out. Save the Children does help more than education as well. They help ensure children's access to health care (which we know is a huge topic of discussion every where),and help improve their safety and well being. Many kids do not have access to safe living conditions to even make it to school each day.  What ever charity my grocery store is supporting at the time. Typically children related, sometimes it is for others. It is easy to just add a couple cents on top of my purchase (round up the total) to help their cause.  I was directly contacted by the research team to help get donations for this amazing cause. Helping indirectly is one thing (like through the store) but actually giving when you can be a direct part is so much better. Wouldn't you like to give just $0.50 to this cause? It can provide paper and pencils to a child for school.  Any amount can make a difference, especially when everyone does a small part.  Your donation is greatly appreciated! ",0,FALSE

"How are you this holiday weekend? Very good.  We were looking to have a cookout, but it's raining, so I have a bit of time for some mturk work. Yes, I have been asked to solicit a donation to the Save the Children charity. It's been around almost forever.  Save the Children supports nutrition, sanitation and education initiatives in the US and third world countries. None that I am aware of.  I'm surprised you've never heard of it.  They have run television commercials off and on for decades. Less than 10% of the money raised goes for fund raising purposes, and only 5% for management.  Over 85% goes directly to recipients.  It is one of the most efficient charities around and is highly rated by the groups that do such things. You can donate the money that you are receiving for this mturk task, up to $2.  It's for a good cause. I suspect that end of the conversation, you will be asked to donate a specific amount.  But it can't hurt to state how much of it you would like to donate.  With me, there's something about holiday weekends that makes me feel more charitable. What I know is that the research team will collect all the money all the donations and send the money directly to Save the Children. Yes, you are.  Sometimes it's hard to figure out what some of these mturk tasks are going after. The task indicates that we can complete the conversation now.  Thank you for the donation.  I hope the rain stops where you are and you can enjoy the rest of the day.",2,TRUE

Mother nature has been a little temperamental these past few years. Have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children?  Yes, hurricanes can be dreadful, tornadoes as well. Save the Children is an amazing charity that I'm collecting donations for today. I personally feel like it's our moral obligation to make sure that all children are well taken care of. Don't you agree? You are so right! Sadly many children are subjected to violence or are living on the streets starving and sick. You said you had seen a commercial. What about it appealed to you? That's one of the amazing things about Save the Children. We are a global charity, offering food, clean water, educational material, and vaccines to children that need it most. Our website offers much education to the public about living conditions and the negative things that affect these innocent children.  Exactly! Most people spend countless amounts of money on wasted product or food when something as small as $1.00 can benefit one of these children. Did you know that in the first two months of this year, 1,000 children were reported killed or injured in Syria. That's so heartbreaking and it angers me. How does it make you feel? I completely agree. Save the Children is also known for providing children who live in hazardous conditions such as war zones with more security and safety. If more people in this world felt like you and I, I believe all children would have a better chance at life, don't you? I agree wholeheartedly! How much would you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment, $2? That is amazing! Thank you so much.

Hey have you ever heard of a organization called Save the Children? Oh wow! That's wonderful to hear, well I wanted to let you know this HIT allows us to donate a portion of our tasks payment directly to the organization! I can understand that, if I told you I'd match your donation would you be able to donate just a small portion perhaps? I try to always donate even just a small amount for the suffering kid's sake.",0,FALSE
"Hello Do you have any kids? I've got 3 Two boys in college are close, 20 and 19. Daughter is 14 and lives with her mom. LOL, I wish...even state school is expensive. Having kids is the worst financial decision someone can make - but I'd make that decision again ithout question. Tough getting by sometimes, but you do what you can.   Good on you for getting college degree! Education is so important, they can never take that away from you. Alot of families need help with basic stuff, let alone worrying about education. My boys did alot of service type stuff with underprivileged kids when they were younger. Chemistry is black magic to me, my older son is a whiz at it. When they were scouts they did service for Save the Children. Have you ever heard of it? They do great work. It's amazing how far they can stretch even a little bit of change. Would you consider donating part of your payment for this task to them? That's great! I'll do the same. Absolutely. I like to think of it as an investment in the future. I think that was UNICEF. I remember that from more than a few years ago. Time to get onto to the next HIT. Good luck with your chemistry degree - don't blow anything up! Thanks for donating to Save the Children!",1,TRUE
"So I am going to need you to donate to Save The children charity. or else........  I'm great! How are you? That is good to hear! So,are you familiar with the Save The Children children charity? Wait wait wait,are you serious? I haven't heard about that.Was this recent? That may have been the American Red Cross. I think I heard something about them not using all of the funds given to them to help the people that were hurt during. Oh,I love Bon Jovi. Knowing how great he is I'm pretty sure he helps a ton of charity's.  Haha,I see what you did there. So would you be able to make any sort of donation to the Save the children charity? Of course it will be deducted from your task payment and it can be anywhere from 0.01 to $2. It will be deducted from your bonus,but you hold the power of how much will be taken. Like me I would enjoy my max amount so to show good faith to the researchers completing this task I would just throw 0.01-0.10.  That is great to hear! I know for a fact that the researchers conducting this survey and the Save The Children foundation will be excited to know you gave back. I thank you.

"Hi, how are you today? Great, thanks! Since we're here to talk about a social issue, are you familiar with Save the Children? I am fairly familiar with them. They are an international organization that promotes children's rights and provides relief and support. I think they do great work for the children of the world. Me, too. I see a lot of images on tv and on the internet of children suffering because of lack of resources and aid and it breaks my heart. I don't have a lot but I try to do what I can to help. A charity like Save the Children relies on donations. They are non-governmental so all their funding comes from those willing to donate. I try to donate when I can.  With Save the Children I trust that the money goes to the children. Other charities you have to watch out for but I've heard nothing but good about Save the Children. I never know how much to donate though. I want to help as much as I can, and even sometimes just a few dollars helps. How do you feel about donation amounts? I often donate some of my earnings here. For example, I might use some of what I make today as a donation, especially from this HIT since it's what we're discussing. I tend to feel guilty if I talk positively about something and then don't follow through. We are allowed to donate some of this HIT to Save the Children if we want. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. Would you be willing to donate $1 or more from this HIT? That's great. I'll donate $1, too.  That's great. They are definitely a worthy charity and do so much good. I appreciate you hearing me out and taking the time to research more.",0.7,TRUE
"Hello, how are you today? Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Save the Children is an organization that helps children all around the world that are in need. Where are you from? The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice. Today they work to help in health, education, protection, hunger and livelihood, crisis management, and advocacy for children around the world. Which of those sounds the most interesting? I am also from the United States, in South Carolina. I live in a rural town and many of the families around here are poor and have been poor for a long time. One of the major reasons for poverty is a lack of education, even from a very young age. Do you have any interest in doing your part to help out these children to help them rise from poverty? Yes exactly! In America, more than 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. In rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Save Our Children reached 638,000 kids 2016 through their programs! This is a good start, and you can help to do more. In this HIT, you are able to donate a portion of your $2 earnings to save the children. The researchers will collect the donations from the chat-logs and send them to Save the Children! Would you like to hear more about the education programs or any other programs before you decide how much to donate? Save or Children is actually one of the good ones! Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. This percentage is adjusted each year end _ as of 2017, it is 86%. The rest? Save our Children uses it to support the mission _ running our programs and raising funds to help more children. The funds would be split to different programs they run that support the mission. Should I tell you about some other programs in the mission? One example is Syria. After 7 years of war, Syria is now the #1 most dangerous country to be a child. ""There is no food and we can\'t go outside. the planes are bombing,"" says a terrified child. ""One of my friends died in front of me - and I saw the blood,"" cries another. According to a boy in besieged Eastern Ghouta, ""It feels like the end of the world."" Save the Children provides lifesaving services and supplies. They tend to children\'s physical and psychological needs and set up places for children in crisis to learn and play. Yes and you can help for less than the price of a cup of coffee! Despite extreme humanitarian challenges, Save the Children has helped 2.5 million people in Syria, including 1.7 million children. This is just one of the many amazing programs that Save the Children does around the world. Do you think you would like to make a donation today? Well it all goes to the organization, the way that they use the money about 90% goes to funding programs in rural America, Syria, etc...and 10% goes to the running costs of events, administrative costs, etc... which also - even if a little indirectly - help further their mission. How much would you like to give? You can give any amount up to $2 out of your HIT reward Ok thank you for your donation of $0.50! Taking a bit out of your mturk earnings to do some good in the world! It was a pleasure talking to you, and thank you for your work. I am going to end the chat now.",0.5,TRUE
"Hello! How are you doing today? I am good.  I am asking you to donate a portion of your hit earnings to Save the Children.  Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Sure!  First it's a reputable organization and trustworthy. Independent charity watchdog groups give them high ratings. They help in many ways, help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.  Things we tend to take for granted. That's where those independent watchdog groups I mentioned have rated them highly.  For example, about 87% of their money goes to their programs.   The healthcare initiatives include maternal, newborn and child health. For example, they target child malnutrition and hunger and prevent HIV transmission, and ensure treatment for those living with HIV before they develop AIDS.  All in all they help to give 86 million children a healthy start in life and help 33.3 million children directly with lifesaving care, medicines and preventive treatments. It's not just providing food, though that is a part of it.  They also help to build household and community resilience to food security and economic shocks and stresses. Strengthen socio-economic conditions to improve standards of living and the ability of families to provide for their children. I really like that they provide youth with the skills and linkages they need to earn and manage a decent income. I really thank you for thinking about donating.  This small amount can make a huge difference to children in need.  You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).  How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.  Thank you very much! I work with at-risk children for a living, so this is something I am passionate about.  I really appreciate it! Have a good night and a good week! (we may need to send a few more messages before we can end this hit)",0.2,TRUE
"Hello, how are you today? Wonderful!  Thank you.  Have you heard of a charity called Save the Children? Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights.  Would you like to know more? Your individual donation will help individual children and their families. What if I were to tell you that 100% of your donation would go directly to helping one child? I agree donating locally is also important.  However, there are so many children that could benefit from just pennies.  It will go to a trustable fund.  What if I match your donation?   Your donation could be directly deducted from your task payment.  Anywhere from a penny to $2 Just 77 cents could help a refugee family and I will match the donation. Okay, then I have an option for you.  You have the ability to sponsor at child in the US!  We spend money on so many little things each day and we have the moral responsibility to help.  So if you would like to help locally.  Can you commit to doing that? This can go to sponsor a child in your town.  Can you just commit to 10 cents?",0,FALSE
"Hello? Not bad how are you? No complaints so far. Yours? Yep same, this is about all the 'work' I've done all day. Right on. So back to 'work'. I was wondering if you would be interested in donating a portion of your payment from this task towards a charity called Save the Children Save the Children is extremely efficient. Well as efficient as a charity can be on a count of the donations they receive. Save the Children is not like some other charities you may hear about that have a handsomely paid CEO with small minuscule percentages going to help the needy.  That's so kind of you thank you. I'm just volunteering for the time being. Myself, like many others who help with Save the Children, volunteer our time for no pay or compensation. You learn a lot about people when you put yourself in this sort of position. I know I feel like a better person for volunteering. I've only started recently. My wife and I discussed doing something for other people as a way for the two of us to spend time together. It's a way for us to feel productive or useful in contrast to our normal boring shut-in selves. Give it a try sometime I don't think you'll regret it. ",0.5,TRUE

No, they assist children in war zones. In Syria, in 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reported to be killed of injured due to rising violence. For every dollar donated, they receive 77 cents.

Would you be interested in saving a child's life today? Are you sure? How many dollars do you spend everyday on pointless or unnecessary items, such as a candy bar or fast food? These children have no way of earning money, as their countries are in shambles. Many die of hunger or preventable disease, up 5.6 million per year. Even 50 cents makes all the difference. Are you from the US? Are you aware of the US bombing civilian cities in developing countries? Killing innocent children for no reason at all?  It also helps children in Europe.

It's an international non-government organization that's primary activity is to help and benefit disadvantaged children in developing countries.

For sure, especially when we're talking children. So many of these kids didn't get to pick their situation and it's so hard to fault them for anything at all. They all deserve at least a shot. Agreed. I appreciate you considering a donation. It's nice that we have the opportunity to complete these little tasks and still do good overall. It certainly makes things easy.

There are kids sleeping in the streets even here in the U.S.  These kids need our help. Fortunately, there is something we can do about it. I completely agree.

I actually have only recently learned of them. Do you plan to continue supporting them? Did you know that this chat is an opportunity to make a donation? What a coincidence that you already support them! That probably skews the research. Well, I'm assuming the researchers want to know how to convince new people to donate. What did you like about their commercials? Children are the future I suppose! And it would be easy to support them here, just have to give up some of the task payment... I might have even convinced myself. How much of your $2 do you plan to donate? That is better than nothing, I suppose. Don't you think you should give more though? It's really somebody else's money. Your choice of course!",0.2,TRUE
"Hello. Have you heard about Save the Children? Save the Children is a non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights and helps provide support for needy children in developing countries around the world. Last year, Save the Children helped to provide education, food, shelter, and other basic necessities for more than 155 million children worldwide. I'm sure you are aware that throughout the world there are millions of children who lack access to basic needs like food, clean water, good clothing, and education. Save the Children works to help those kids, so that they can grow up to be healthy, happy, and productive adults. I'm also glad that organizations like Save the Children are out there making a difference. As I'm sure you also know, Save the Children is reliant on donations to be able to provide the help they do. That's great! I'd like you to know that if you choose to donate to Save the Children, they are a top-rated charity. Last year, 86% of all donated funds went directly into programs to help needy children.  About 5% goes to administration costs, while about 9% is spent on fundraising efforts.

Even just a small amount, such as a few dollars, could help some of the many children suffering from abuse and hunger in places like Syria or India. I am a real person just trying to help When I can, I try to help in any way possible wether that be by donating time or money Like I said, anything helps, I had the opportunity to go to India on a service tri, and it really helped me realize how much has been handed to me compared to the people there. In the village where we were helping, I learned that starving children were sent up to 5 miles away to gather water for their families while their parents worked in the fields Honestly, just that little bit could provide a lot to places like that. I know it's hard to believe but it's true, I've seen it first hand. Plus, by donating it to a place as credible as Save the Children, you know its going where its needed. Absolutely, I understand. One of the really cool things about this organization is that you can very easily access their financial records and revenue on their website, and you are more than welcome to look that up at  URL but if you were to donate even a fraction of your earnings from this HIT, 86% of that would actually go to the services they are providing for this children in impoverished countries 9% goes toward fundraising and the other 5% goes toward management and other expenses of the actually organization  Of course, I understand.

"Hello there. How are you today? Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Save the Children is a charitable organization that promotes children's rights. They also provide relief for children in regions subject to violence and civil unrest, and aid for needy children in developing countries. I originally found out about them when someone talked to me about donating to them. Most of what I know about them comes from reading about them online. They help children in 120 different countries, including the USA and most African, South American, and Asian countries. They are. Save the Children is a very highly rated charity, rated 88.3 out of 100 by Charity Navigator in 2016. They also disclose all of their financial information online, to promote transparency in how they spend the money donated to them. 86% of donations go into programs to help children. Administrative costs are only about 5% of donations, with the remainder going towards fundraising efforts. 5% is a rather low administrative cost for a charity, which is good. And the portion that goes to fundraising generates more donations than the money put into it, so it overall increases the money that gets to those who need it. And any donation helps, even something as low as one or two dollars. It depends of course on the region where the child being helped is located. But in some of the poorer parts of the world, a dollar can buy a few days worth of healthy food, or buy an item of clothing for a child who needs it. Yes, a 1 dollar donation is perfectly acceptable, and greatly appreciated. Excelent! Thank you very much for your donation.",1,TRUE
"Hey, have you heard about Save the Children? Yeah. Pretty much what they do is use donations from charitable, and caring citizens to help children around the world get on a better path to the future. So true. On top of that, they have full financial disclosure of their donations. About 86% goes to program services for less-fortunate kids, and the 14% goes to Fundraising and Management (Personally, I'd like to the latter number go down in the future). Not exactly. Just like any charity, they need to get money for operating costs, so not every single cent goes to the children unfortunatley. But 86% is a lot compared to other organizations. It depends to be honest. You've got to understand that the organization needs money to stay operating, or else they would fail and no children would be helped. Make sense? That's true, have you donated to a charity before? I didn\'t before either, but recently I\'ve been giving little bits here and there when I can. I think of it like... ""What would make me happier? A $1 cup of coffee or using that $1 to help someone in need."" It truly is a rewarding experience. Trust me, I understand haha. I'm in the same situation. But if you had the opportunity now to donate a $1 to Save the Children, you wouldn't? It'd be deducted from the task payment today. If that's too much even $0.50 will help out the children that really need. And hey, maybe someday those kids grow up to be some of the most generous, caring people in the world. Yeah, it's kind of like money that's not in your pocket yet haha. So, to be fair, I'll let you decide the amount of today's payment (0-$2) that gets donated, since you'll be the one making a difference. That's awesome! We need more people like you. Would you like me to provide you with some more information about Save The Children (just the link)?

Ahh, yes I know what you mean. My oldest will be 21 next week, and the youngers ones are in their late teenage years. It goes by so quickly! My husband has a little brother who has Asperger's. Not nearly the level of autism of your son, but I do have empathy for you.  It must be very hard, and also at the same time very rewarding, taking care of a child with special needs.  It is interesting that your daughter is going to school for nursing. Do you think that it's because she has spent her life watching (and I'd assume participating in the) care of her brother? Wow! You must be very proud of her!  She graduated with a degree in Interior Design. She has been a designer since she was about 3 years old! LOL  My other girls, though, have no idea what they like, except that they all like taking care of children (all work in day care or nanny jobs). I am with you there! I have absolutely zero flair for style. But my daughter has always been able to put things together so well. I honestly don't know where she got it from! But, I am happy that at least someone in the family can make us look good. Haha  And yes, they are all so good with little ones. It does make me feel good to see that. I feel like I must have done some good things right as a mom, if they like kids so much! I am sure you have done a great job with both of your kids! It sounds like they are very special!

And the charity is highly rated with many positive rewards.  Including an ""A"" rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.   It was founded way back on April 15, 1919! A charity with that kind of history shows that it has made an amazing impact.  Just last year they helped a total of 155 million children! The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need. I know I was surprised by those numbers.  A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.  That's important to me in a charity. That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful. Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to ""fundraising, management, and general"" as the website says.  That\'s good to hear that it\'s not all about filling some people\'s pockets. Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.

Many of these children don't have the same opportunities as others and live in very difficult conditions. That's great!  It is a worthwhile cause and every penny has a significant impact on these children's lives.  Even a small donation can have a large impact in impoverished areas. Of course.  I chose those words because across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty and, of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural. Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential. I agree that children in both settings need help and commend you for your efforts.  Admittedly, Save the Children may also have urban programs, but I drew the above information from their website, which you can find at  URL   Are you still interested in donating a portion of your reward? Yes, you should be able to specify that.  The researchers will use this chat to determine how much of your reward to donate and will see that you have earmarked it for Save the Children's US efforts.  Excellent!  Thank you very much for your generous donation!",1,TRUE

Yesterday was humid, and I still haven't stepped outside today. Still in the AC! Oh wow, I used to live in Jersey City, which is a ride away from NYC. So cool. I went to school there from nonprofit management, and ironically I'm working with a group called Save The Children. It's an org that provides basic assistance to children around the world with necessities needed to live. Ones we often take for granted in the states. We're currently seeking donations up to $2. Are you interested in giving back a bit of $$? It could do so much good in the life of a hungry, neglected, or abused child.  Oh wow. Do you have a boy or a girl? I totally understand your position. Again, no amount is too small. One penny donated from your earnings could do a lot of good in the 3rd world. I'll match whatever you decide to give. I'm not floating in money either, but to me this is worth it. Let me know. Well total congrats to you on new mother! And thank you so much for your donation! I will of course match that $.25. I think $.50 from the both us us can go a long way. Every little bit counts. I believe in karma as well. Is the father of your child expected to recover soon and be released. That is so terrible. For anyone, but especially a new dad. You totally have my prayers and positive energy. I'm glad you found your calling. I work online and do on demand jobs as well. It started out due to illness, but I really like it. I like Turking, but I also like Microworkers, TextBroker (writing), and finding gigs on Upwork.com. Are there any good online work sites you'd recommend? I'm up for any job. Oh so cool. When I was driving for uber last year, I drove a woman with epilepsy, who just began having seizures recently, and we were talking about remedies for her. I suggested the legal CBD oil as I began taking it for anxiety, and she said she would check it out. A lot of people have also been helped with legal marijuana, but I don't think that's available in GA. And that sucks. Oh wow so cool. I know funds are low, but in the future are there any causes you feel strongly about that you would put your money behind? Oh. Recently I've become interested in donating to people who are wrongfully incarcerated. I'd like to donate to their legal fees. Like you, I do believe in karma and goodness, but haven't really donated much. Matching your donation today makes me feel really good. Thank you so much, have a great day!

I like to donate a little bit to them from time to time, not much mind you, I don't really have or make a lot of money, but it's nice knowing I can contribute at least a little something. Anything that can help. Sometimes it can really brighten my day knowing I might have helped someone. Would you consider making a small donation from a portion of the HIT completion compensation, something as little as .10 cents? That would be awesome!

I ike doing some of theses surveys then hearing the results later on, passively, since I don\'t really know at the time of doing them what they\'re for really. It\'s fun to say, ""Hey, I participated in that study"" Those are pretty good. My favorite one so far has been recording my voice saying various words for a study on accents in speech.

I'm actually in the northeast part of the country, but when there's a big storm down south we get some of the effects of it. But I hope it doesn't get too bad where you are, it seems like storms get worse and worse every year. Wow I didn't know that, that's pretty gross. Yeah climate change is pretty crazy. And people don't even realize the impact it has on human beings, like the weather and pollution is really affecting agriculture and making it harder to grow crops. And there's all the damage from storms of course, people still struggling months and months after hurricanes. Oh cool I'm vegan too actually. It was the same for me, I made the switch to reduce cancer risk since there's a lot of that in my family, but eventually it became an environmental/animal rights thing. I've been vegan for about 6 years and was vegetarian for about 5 before that. I'm so sorry to hear hurricane Harvey affected you. Were there any government programs or non-profits that helped you to recover? Wow that's really great to hear! My parents won't go vegan or vegetarian themselves but have definitely started making healthier choices since I went vegan. I guess every little effort helps, right? And that's really good to know you got help when you needed it. There's a charity called Save the Children that's still helping kids in Texas fully recover from Harvey. You can actually donate a small amount from your task payment today to support them. Would you be interested in helping them out? Awesome, how much would you like to donate? You can pick any amount and it will be deducted from your task payment. That's really great, thank you! Can I ask how you first heard about Save the Children?

"Hey! How are you? Doing really well. I was curious if you have any particular charities that you admire or donate to. I've got a couple that I am interested in but sometimes I wonder if the money goes where they say, you know? I did a survey on here a while back that laid out a couple charities really thoroughly and then offered to let me give up some of my ""reward"" for the survey to the charity. I thought it was an interesting idea. Plus sometimes I\'m just lazy and that\'s an easy uncomplicated way to do it. Remember that ice bucket challenge thing that was super popular a while back? I thought it was fun but wouldn't do anything productive. Turns out they raised so much money it some drug trial through and they've found a drug that helps and is now on the market and that just blew me away. Downside of course is people still have to part with money they already had. I donated some of my reward to the charity because it wasn't really out of my pocket and I guess I figured every little bit might help. I know and besides it got my son to dump a bucket of ice water on himself which was just hilarious. That's really true. Maybe on top of people not wanting the rigamarole of the donation process sometimes all we need is a better understanding of the need or just faith that a little from everyone can go a long way.  Yeah, maybe, people just need information, ease of donating, and a sense of community about it all. This HIT we are doing is kind of doing the same thing as that other survey I did. We both get our base pay and then can choose to keep the added incentive or donate a portion of it to the charity Save the Children. I was contemplating giving some of mine away. I've worked overseas with kids through medical clinics and have seen how far what we think of as a small amount of money can really go. I was going to donate half of mine. Some for me for the work and some for them in the hopes it helps.  How much would you like to donate to Save the Children out of the payment? Brilliant. That's so kind of you. Between us both I hope it helps. And I love that they are giving their money to something other than profit, you know?",0.75,TRUE

There has been a lot of negative press the last few years with some charities where it has been exposed that they aren't using the funds for the cause to their maximum potential. But I did my research with Save the Children, and almost all of the money donated goes right towards the cause. Very minimal funds go towards the actual organization and administration efforts. I do agree! Would you be willing to donate anything today towards this cause? .77 cents a day can actually put a refugee family in a home for a day...even just a little can go a long way! Thank you!

"What is your opinion of donating to charity?  I agree! I think it's really important, though, to know that the charity you're giving to is going to use the funds well and isn't corrupt.  That\'s awesome and such an important step. Have you ever heard of ""Save the Children""? I worked with them in Greece; they operate in refugee camps and other high-risk zones to address specifically the needs of kids Actually, many Greek refugee camps are rated as as-bad or worse than many camps in war zones. It's complete chaos, overrun by gangs and gang violence, and often lacking in basic hygiene and access to clean water or food. Women are frequently raped while trying to use the toilets (which are horrendous) and rats run amok among the tents. One of the children we were working with had a huge rat bite on her foot and many of them had fled to Greece on their own.  It was nuts - we even had a neo-Nazi mob hunting us in the streets one night. I definitely did not feel safe there. We tried to do our best to get kids registered and provide English classes and some amount of regularity for them. Save the Children created a space just for kids and mothers and were able to assist with getting them into school Well, yeah, but it's much more important to address the things shaping the lives of these children. That's why I think it's so important to donate to Save the Children. Even if we can't always be there, they are making the effort everyday I do donate directly, not just to Save the Children, but to several other organizations as well. I still have friends working over there. This HIT we're doing has offered to donate some of our income to the charity. I always take MTurk requesters up on it when they ask us to donate our earnings. I mean, other people can use the $2 more than me, right?  Hey, that's awesome! Actually you're allowed to donate anywhere from $0-$2, not just your 30 cents! It's completely up to you. Once we decide to donate then they'll send the payment to Save the Children Absolutely! There are so many organizations around the world these days it's hard to know which one is the best. Do you know the website charitynavigator.org? It provides info on tons of organizations around the world  Oh, no, that's just one I use if someone is recommended a charity to me. I got involved with Save the Children because I was working with a local NGO in Greece and we partnered with them frequently for English classes and kid's activities and safety It was lovely to meet you! Thanks for donating your 30 cents! ",0.3,TRUE
"Hello, how are you today? I am fine thank. Are you interested in donating? donating to charities, like children's charity It is called ""Save the Children"" charity. They work on children\'s issues all around the world Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. I have donated to this organization through HITs, but I do not have enough free time to be volunteered in person. I read about them and they are clear with their financial reports. I think you're right I can't trust every charity, but some big companies cooperate with them like Disney and IKEA. and donating did not hurt the reward of the HIT so I did not lose anything anyway I think I at least donated 10 times before though HITs, my payment was never less than $2. but I trusted this charity so much I decided to help on its website too I will donate $1, but you can donate less if you want even 10 cents or 5 cents. anything is possible I will donate $1 actually, I promise. thank you for your time and attention. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

"Hello! I have something really important that I would like to talk to you about today. Great! Have you ever heard of the Save the Children Foundation? Well, it is an international non-governmental organization that promotes the rights of children in war torn areas. It provides relief and helps support the children in these developing countries. Does this sound like something you could be passionate about? It is a great organization because they use donations really well. They are able to tangibly help these kiddos. They have a huge interntional impact. What do you think about that? Do you have any questions about the organization? It was founded in 1919! So its almost had a century of impact.  The people who run it are non-for profit and do it full time! You know what is really awesome though? We can help! This program that we are doing right now on MTURK allows us to donate some of our earnings to Save the Children. It is such a simple and easy way to make an impact if one wanted to. 9 of every 10 dollars goes directly to children in need! So only 10% to administrative costs. The other thing is that we can help a child by donating the cost of a candy bar!  Volunteers provide the relief work through a variety of programs and emergency aid. The money is distributed where it is needed most - so if there is an emergency more money will go there. But there is a question that I would like to ask you. Would you be willing to donate $0.20 to the relief work if I match the donation from this Mturk task? Together we can make a difference! Awesome! You are the best!",0.2,TRUE
