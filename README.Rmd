# ConTextNet

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ConTextNet is to discover influential text features from a corpus,
given an outcome of interest. These text features can be used to estimate causal
effects on the outcome using a generalization of the framework presented in
Fong & Grimmer (2016, 2021), or can be viewed as exploratory evidence to guide
confirmatory analyses where researchers design a small number of treatment
texts. To do this, ConTextNet walks users through building, training, tuning,
and interpreting a neural network with convolutional layers. ConTextNet relies
heavily on R Keras for modeling, and will likely require users to run at least
some operations on a high performance computing cluster (HPC) for corpora larger 
than a few thousand documents. The package will provide documentation and helper
functions to guide users through the necessary Python dependency installations
and to streamline interactions with common HPC interfaces.


## Installation

You can install the development version of ConTextNet like so:

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE? -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- ## library(ConTextNet) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
